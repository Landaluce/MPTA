MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     17 
 OVERVIEW Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company 
headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At December 31, 2011, the 
Bancorp had $117 billion in assets, operated 15 affiliates with 1,316 
full-service Banking Centers, including 104 Bank Mart® locations 

open seven days a week inside select grocery stores, and 2,425 

ATMs in 12 states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern 
regions of the United States. The Bancorp reports on four business 

segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer 

Lending and Investment Advisors. The Bancorp also has a 49% 

interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC, formerly Fifth Third Processing 
Solutions, LLC. 
This overview of MD&A highlights selected information in the 
financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the 
information that is important to you. For a more complete 

understanding of trends, even
ts, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and 

estimates, you should carefully read
 this entire document. Each of 
these items could have an impact on the Bancorp™s financial 
condition, results of operations and 
cash flows. In addition, see the Glossary of Terms in this report for a list of acronyms included as a 
tool for the reader of this annual report on Form 10-K. The 

acronyms identified therein are used throughout this MD&A, as 
well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Bancorp believes that banking is first and foremost a relationship business where the strength of the competition and 
challenges for growth can vary in every market. The Bancorp 
believes its affiliate operating model provides a competitive 

advantage by emphasizing individual relationships. Through its 

affiliate operating model, individual
 managers at all levels within the 
affiliates are given the opportunity to tailor financial solutions for 

their customers. The Bancorp™s revenues are dependent on both net interest 
income and noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 
2011, net interest income, on a FTE basis, and noninterest income 
provided 59% and 41% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp 

derives the majority of its revenues within the United States from 

customers domiciled in the United States. Revenue from foreign 

countries and external customers do
miciled in foreign countries is 

immaterial to the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Changes in interest rates, credit
 quality, economic trends and the 
capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the 
Bancorp. As discussed later in th
e Risk Management section, risk 
identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are 
important to the management of risk and to the financial 

performance and capital strength of the Bancorp.  
Net interest income is the difference between interest income 
earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest 

expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, short-term 

borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by 
the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and 
long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the 
amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-

bearing liabilities. Generally, the rate
s of interest the Bancorp earns 
on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of 

time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the 

Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to 

net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of 
its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest 

rates, the timing of their maturiti
es and their sensitivity to changes 
in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of 
business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as 

part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment 
risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of losses on its loan 

and lease portfolio, as a result of changing expected cash flows 
caused by loan defaults and inad
equate collateral due to a weakened 
economy within the Bancorp™s footprint. 
Net interest income, net interest margin and the efficiency ratio 
are presented in MD&A on a FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for 

the tax-favored status of income fr
om certain loans and securities 
held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax 

purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the 

preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it 

provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable 

amounts.  Noninterest income is derived primarily from mortgage 
banking net revenue, service charges on deposits, corporate banking 

revenue, investment advisory revenue and card and processing 
revenue. Noninterest expense is primarily driven by personnel costs, 

occupancy expenses, costs incurred in the origination of loans and 

leases and insurance premiums paid to the FDIC. 
 
Common Stock and Senior Notes Offerings 
On January 25, 2011, the Bancorp raised $1.7 billion in new 
common equity through the issuance of 121,428,572 shares of 
common stock in an underwritten offering at an initial price of 

$14.00 per share. On January 24, 
2011, the underwriters exercised 
their option to purchase an additional 12,142,857 shares at the 

offering price of $14.00 per share. 
In connection with this exercise, 
the Bancorp entered into a forward 
sale agreement which resulted in 
a final net payment of 959,821 shares on February 4, 2011. On January 25, 2011, the Bancorp issued $1.0 billion of Senior 
notes to third party investors, and entered into a Supplemental 

Indenture dated January 25, 2011 
with Wilmington Trust Company, 
as Trustee, which modifies the existing Indenture for Senior Debt Securities dated April 30, 2008 between the Bancorp and the 

Trustee. The Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture define the 

rights of the Senior notes, which Senior notes are represented by 

Global Securities dated as of January 25, 2011. The Senior notes 
bear a fixed rate of interest of 3.625% per annum. The notes are 
unsecured, senior obligations of 
the Bancorp. Payment of the full 
principal amount of the notes w
ill be due upon maturity on January 
25, 2016. The notes will not be subject to the redemption at the 

Bancorp™s option at any time prior to maturity. 
 Repurchase of Outstanding TARP Preferred Stock  

As further discussed in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements, on December 31, 2008, the Bancorp issued 
$3.4 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, 
Series F, and related warrants to the U.S. Treasury under the U.S. 

Treasury™s CPP.  On February 2, 2011, the Bancorp redeemed all 136,320 shares 
of its Series F Preferred Stock held by the U.S. Treasury. As 

discussed above, the net proceeds from the Bancorp™s January 2011 

common stock and senior notes offerings and other funds were 
used to redeem the $3.4 billion of Series F Preferred Stock. 
In connection with the redemption of the Series F preferred 
Stock, the Bancorp accelerated the accretion of the remaining 
issuance discount on the Series F Preferred Stock and recorded a 

corresponding reduction in retained earnings of $153 million. This 

resulted in a one-time, noncash reduction in net income available to 

common shareholders and related basic and diluted earnings per 

share. Dividends of $15 million were paid on February 2, 2011 
when the Series F Preferred Stock was redeemed. The Bancorp paid 
total dividends of $356 million to the U.S. Treasury while the Series 

F Preferred Stock was outstanding.  
On March 16, 2011, the Bancorp repurchased the warrant 
issued to the U.S. Treasury in 
connection with the CPP preferred 
stock investment at an agreed upon price of $280 million, which was 

recorded as a reduction to capital surplus in the Bancorp™s 

Consolidated Financial Statements. The warrant gave the U.S. 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
18     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 Treasury the right to purchase 43,617,747 shares of the Bancorp™s 
common stock at $11.72 per share.  

 
Redemption of Trust Preferred Securities 
On March 18, 2011, the Bancorp announced that the FRB did not 
object to the Bancorp™s capital plan submitted under the FRB™s 2011 

CCAR. Pursuant to this plan, during the second quarter of 2011 the 

Bancorp redeemed certain trust preferred securities, totalling $452 
million, which related to the Fift
h Third Capital Trust VII, First 
National Bankshares Statutory Trust I and R&G Capital Trust II, 

LLT. During the third quarter of 
2011, pursuant to the previously 

mentioned plan, the Bancorp redeemed certain trust preferred 
securities, totalling $40 million, which related to the R&G Crown 
Cap Trust IV and First National 
Bankshares Statutory Trust II. 
During the fourth quarter of 2011, pursuant to the previously 
mentioned plan, the Bancorp redeemed certain trust preferred 

securities, totalling $25 million, which related to the RG Crown Cap 

Trust I. As a result of these redemptions, the Bancorp recorded a $7 

million gain on the extinguishment of this debt within other 
noninterest expense in the Bancor
p™s Consolidated Statements of 
Income.  
 
Legislative Developments 

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Ac
t was signed into law. This act implements changes to the financial services industry and affects the 

lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of 

financial institutions and their hol
ding companies. The legislation 
establishes a CFPB responsible for implementing and enforcing compliance with consumer financial laws, changes the methodology 

for determining deposit insurance assessments, gives the FRB the ability to regulate and limit interc
hange rates charged to merchants for the use of debit cards, enac
ts new limitations on proprietary 
trading, broadens the scope of derivative instruments subject to 
regulation, requires on-going stress tests and the submission of 
annual capital plans for certain or
ganizations and requires changes 
to regulatory capital ratios. This act also calls for federal regulatory 

agencies to conduct multiple studies over the next several years in 

order to implement its provisions.  
The Bancorp was impacted by a number of the components of 
the Dodd-Frank Act which were implemented during 2011. The 

CFPB began operations on July 21,
 2011. The CFPB holds primary responsibility for regulating consumer protection by enforcing 
existing consumer laws, writin
g new consumer legislation, conducting bank examinations, monitoring and reporting on 
markets, as well as collecting 
and tracking consumer complaints. The FRB final rule implementing
 the Dodd-Frank Act™s ﬁDurbin Amendmentﬂ, which limits debit card interchange fees, was issued 

on July 21, 2011 for transactions occurring after September 30, 

2011. The final rule establishes a 
cap on the fees banks with more 
than $10 billion in assets can charge merchants for debit card 
transactions. The fee was set at $.21 per transaction plus an additional 5 bps of the transacti
on amount and $.01 to cover fraud 
losses. The FRB repealed Regulation Q as mandated by the Dodd-

Frank Act on July 21, 2011. Regulation Q was implemented as part 

of the Glass-Steagall Act in the 1930™s and provided a prohibition 

against the payment of interest on demand deposits. While the total 

impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on Fifth Third is not currently 

known, the impact is expected to be substantial and may have an 
adverse impact on Fifth Third™s financial performance and growth 
opportunities.

         Earnings Summary 

The Bancorp™s net income available to common shareholders for 
the year ended December 31, 2011 was $1.1 billion, or $1.18 per 
diluted share, which was net of $203 million in preferred stock 

dividends. The Bancorp™s net 
income available to common 
shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $503 

million, or $0.63 per diluted share, which was net of $250 million in 

preferred stock dividends. The preferred stock dividends during 

2011 included $153 million in discount accretion resulting from the 

Bancorp™s repurchase of Series F preferred stock.  
Net interest income was $3.6 billion for the years ended 
December 31, 2011 and 2010. Net interest income in 2011 

compared to the prior year was impacted by a 22 bps decrease in  
average yield on average interest earning assets offset by a 25 bps 

decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and a  
$3.2 billion decrease in average interest bearing liabilities, coupled 
with a mix shift to lower cost deposits. Net interest margin was 

3.66% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.  
Noninterest income decreased $274 million, or 10%, in 2011 
compared to 2010 primarily as the result of $152 million litigation 

settlement related to one of the Bancorp™s BOLI policies during the 

third quarter of 2010, a $54 million decrease in service charges on 

deposits primarily due to the impact of Regulation E and a $50 
million decrease in mortgage banking net revenue primarily as the 
result of a decrease in origination fees and a decrease in gains on 
loan sales partially offset by an increase in net servicing revenue.   
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     19 
 Noninterest expense decreased $97 million, or three percent, in 
2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a decrease of $59 million in 
the provision for representation and warranty claims related to 

residential mortgage loans sold to third parties; a decrease of $41 
million in FDIC insurance and other taxes, a $22 million decrease 
from the change in the provision for unfunded commitments and 

letters of credit, a $21 million decrease in intangible asset 

amortization and a $19 million decrease in professional service fees. 

This activity was partially offset 
by a $64 million increase in total personnel costs (salaries, wages and incentives plus employee 

benefits).   
 Credit Summary 

The Bancorp does not originate subprime mortgage loans and does 

not hold asset-backed securities ba
cked by subprime mortgage loans in its securities portfolio. However, the Bancorp has exposure to 

disruptions in the capital markets and weakened economic 

conditions. Throughout 2010 and 2011, the Bancorp continued to 

be affected by high unemployment rates, weakened housing 

markets, particularly in the upper Midwest and Florida, and a 
challenging credit environment. Credit trends have improved, and as 
a result, the provision for loan and lease losses decreased to $423 million in 2011 compared to $1.5 billion in 2010. In addition, net 

charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases decreased to 
1.49% during 2011 compared to 3.02% during 2010. At December 

31, 2011, nonperforming assets as a percent of loans, leases and 

other assets, including OREO (excluding nonaccrual loans held for 

sale) decreased to 2.23%, compared to 2.79% at December 31, 
2010. For further discussion on credit quality, see the Credit Risk 
Management section in MD&A. 

 
Capital Summary 

The Bancorp™s capital ratios exceed
 the ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ guidelines 
as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 

System. As of December 31, 2011, the Tier I capital ratio was 

11.91%, the Tier I leverage ratio was 11.10% and the total risk-
based capital ratio was 16.09%.   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
  MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
20     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital 
utilization and adequacy, including the 
tangible equity ratio, tangible 
common equity ratio and Tier I common equity ratio, in addition to 

capital ratios defined by banking regulators. These calculations are 
intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking 

regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because 

U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp 

believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to 

these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or 

codified in the federal banking 
regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Since analysts and 
banking regulators may assess the Bancorp™s capital adequacy using 
these ratios, the Bancorp believes they are useful to provide 

investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis. 
The Bancorp believes these non-GAAP measures are 
important because they reflect the level of capital available to 
withstand unexpected market c
onditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of the 
Bancorp™s capitalization to other 
organizations. However, because 
there are no standardized definitions for these ratios, the Bancorp™s 
calculations may not be comparab
le with other organizations, and 
the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited. As a 

result, the Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Consolidated 

Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single 

financial measure.  
Pre-provision net revenue is net interest income plus 
noninterest income minus noninterest expense and taxable 

equivalent adjustment. The Bancorp believes this measure is 

important because it provides a ready view of the Bancorp™s 

earnings before the impact of provision expense.  
The following table reconciles non-GAAP financial measures 
to U.S. GAAP as of December 31:

MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     21 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides 
a discussion of the significant new 
accounting standards adopted by 
the Bancorp during 2011 and the expected impact of significant 

accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted.  
   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require 

management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, 

economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the 
value of the Bancorp™s assets or liabilities and results of operations 

and cash flows. The Bancorp's critical accounting policies include 

the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, 

income taxes, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements 
and goodwill. No material changes were made to the valuation 
techniques or models described below during the year ended 
December 31, 2011.  

 ALLL 
The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The 

Bancorp™s portfolio segments include commercial, residential 
mortgage, and consumer. The Banc
orp further disaggregates its 
portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and 
assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. Classes 

within the commercial portfolio segment include commercial and 

industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial 

mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction, and 
commercial leasing. The residential mortgage portfolio segment is 
also considered a class. Classes within the consumer segment 
include home equity, automobile, cr
edit card, and other consumer 
loans and leases. For an analysis of the Bancorp™s ALLL by 
portfolio segment and credit quality 
information by class, see Note 
6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb probable loan and 
lease losses inherent in its portfolio segments. The ALLL is 

maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is 

based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the 
collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. 
Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. 

Provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the Bancorp™s 

review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, 
in management™s judgment, deserve consideration under existing 

economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. In 

determining the appropriate level of the ALLL, the Bancorp 

estimates losses using a range derived from ﬁbaseﬂ and 
ﬁconservativeﬂ estimates. The Bancorp™s strategy for credit risk 
management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits 
significantly below legal lending limits and conservative 

underwriting, documentation and coll
ections standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification 
on a geographic, industry and 
customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly 
management reviews of large credit exposures and loans 

experiencing deterioration of credit quality.  
The Bancorp™s methodology for determining the ALLL is 
based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific 

allocation on loans modified in a TDR and impaired commercial 

credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. 

Allowances on individual commercial loans, TDRs and historical 

loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on 

changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual 

collection and charge-off experience. An unallocated allowance is 
maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and 

measuring losses when evaluating allowances for individual loans or 

pools of loans.  
Larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower 
relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or 
observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been 

modified in a TDR, are subject to
 individual review for impairment. 
The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality 

of any guarantees, the guaranto
r™s liquidity and willingness to 
cooperate, the loan structure, and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. Other factors may include 
the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and 
financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the 

borrower, and the Bancorp™s evaluation of the borrower™s 

management. When individual lo
ans are impaired, allowances are 
determined based on management™s estimate of the borrower™s 

ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other 

sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options 

available to the Bancorp. Allo
wances for impaired loans are 
measured based on the present value 
of expected future cash flows 
discounted at the loan™s effective interest rate, fair value of the 

underlying collateral or readily obs
ervable secondary market values. 
The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and 

interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. 
Historical credit loss rates are 
applied to commercial loans that 
are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established 
threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance 
allocations. The loss rates are derived from a migration analysis, 
which tracks the historical net charge-off experience sustained on 

loans according to their internal risk grade. The risk grading system 

utilized for allowance analysis purpos
es encompasses ten categories.  
Homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and 
consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded. 

Rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring 
are used to assess credit risks, and allowances are established based 
on the expected net charge-offs. 
Loss rates are based on the trailing twelve month net charge-off history by loan category. Historical loss 
rates may be adjusted for certain pr
escriptive and qualitative factors 
that, in management™s judgment, are necessary to reflect losses 

inherent in the portfolio. Factors that management considers in the 
analysis include the effects of the national and local economies; 

trends in the nature and volume 
of delinquencies, charge-offs and 
nonaccrual loans; changes in loan mix; credit score migration 
comparisons; asset quality trends; risk management and loan 
administration; changes in the internal lending policies and credit 

standards; collection practices; and examination results from bank 

regulatory agencies and the Bancorp™s internal credit reviewers.  
Loans acquired by the Bancorp through a purchase business 
combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. 

The Bancorp does not carry over the acquired company™s ALLL, 

nor does the Bancorp add to its existing ALLL as part of purchase 
accounting. The Bancorp™s primary market areas for lending are the 
Midwestern and Southeastern regi
ons of the United States. When 
evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to 
these regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated 

effect changing economic conditions have on the Bancorp™s 

customers.  Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 
The reserve for unfunded commitmen
ts is maintained at a level 
believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
22     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included 
in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 

determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an 

evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment 
of historical commitment utilization 
experience, credit risk grading 
and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. This 
process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are 

analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorp 

ALLL, as discussed above. Net adjustments to the reserve for 

unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense 

in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 Income Taxes The Bancorp estimates income tax expense based on amounts 

expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which the 
Bancorp conducts business. On 
a quarterly basis, management 
assesses the reasonableness of its e
ffective tax rate based upon its 
current estimate of the amount and components of net income, tax 

credits and the applicable statutor
y tax rates expected for the full 
year. The estimated income tax expense is recorded in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using 
the balance sheet method and are reported in other assets and 
accrued taxes, interest and expenses, respectively in the 

Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under this method, the net deferred 

tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences 

between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and reflects 

enacted changes in tax rates and laws. Deferred tax assets are 
recognized to the extent they ex
ist and are subject to a valuation 
allowance based on management™s judgment that realization is 
more-likely-than-not. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis 

and includes an evaluation of all positive and negative evidence to 

determine whether realization is more-likely-than-not. 
Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to 
taxing jurisdictions and are reported in accrued taxes, interest and 

expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp 
evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax 
treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering 
statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information and 

maintains tax accruals consistent wi
th its evaluation of these relative 
risks and merits. Changes to the 
estimate of accrued taxes occur 
periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, 

the status of examinations being conducted by taxing authorities 

and changes to statutory, judic
ial and regulatory guidance that 
impact the relative risks of tax po
sitions. These changes, when they 
occur, can affect deferred taxes an
d accrued taxes as well as the 
current period™s income tax expense and can be significant to the 

operating results of the Bancorp. For additional information on 

income taxes, see Note 20 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements.  
 Valuation of Servicing Rights 
When the Bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or 

individual loan sales in accordance 
with its investment policies, it 
often obtains servicing rights. Servicing rights resulting from loan 

sales are initially recorded at fair
 value and subsequently amortized 
in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing 

income. Servicing rights are assessed for impairment monthly, based 
on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a 
valuation allowance and permanent 
impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance. 
Key economic assumptions used in measuring any potential 

impairment of the servicing rights include the prepayment speeds of 

the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the discount rate, the 

weighted-average coupon and the we
ighted-average default rate, as 
applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the 

servicing rights resides in the 
potential volatility in the economic 
assumptions used, particularly th
e prepayment speeds. The Bancorp 
monitors risk and adjusts its valuation allowance as necessary to 

adequately reserve for impairment in the servicing portfolio. For 

purposes of measuring impairment,
 the mortgage servicing rights are stratified into classes based on the financial asset type (fixed-rate 

vs. adjustable-rate) and interest rates. For additional information on 

servicing rights, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements. 
 Fair Value Measurements
  The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair 
value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the 
price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction be
tween market participants at the 
measurement date. Valuation techniques the Bancorp uses to 
measure fair value include the ma
rket approach, income approach 
and cost approach. The market appr
oach uses prices or relevant information generated by market tr
ansactions involving identical or 

comparable assets or liabilities. 
The income approach involves 
discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based 
on current market expectations about those future amounts. The 

cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be 

required to replace the service capacity of the asset. 
U.S. GAAP establishes a fair v
alue hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into 

three broad levels. The fair value hi
erarchy gives the highest priority 
to quoted prices in active market
s for identical assets or liabilities 
(Level 1) and the lowest priority 
to unobservable inputs (Level 3). 
An instrument™s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is 
based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the 

instrument™s fair value measurement. 
The three levels within the fair 
value hierarchy are described as follows:    

 Level 1
 Œ Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 

identical assets or liabilities that the Bancorp has the ability 

to access at the measurement date. 
Level 2
 Œ Inputs other than quoted prices included within 
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 

directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: quoted prices 
for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted 

prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 

that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are 

observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are 

derived principally from or corroborated by observable 
market data by correlation or other means. 
Level 3
 Œ Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for 
which there is little, if any, market activity at the 
measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect the 

Bancorp™s own assumptions
 about what market participants would use to pric
e the asset or liability. The 
inputs are developed based on the best information 

available in the circumstances, which might include the 
Bancorp™s own financial data such as internally developed 
pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies, 

as well as instruments for which the fair value 

determination requires significant management judgment. 

 The Bancorp's fair value measurements involve various 
valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are 

observable, when available. Valuation techniques and parameters 
used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated 
by the Bancorp on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Bancorp 

monitors the fair values of sign
ificant assets and liabilities using a 

variety of methods including the 
evaluation of pricing runs and 
exception reports based on certain analyti
cal criteria, comparison to 
previous trades and overall review and assessments for 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     23 
 reasonableness. The following is a summary of valuation techniques 
utilized by the Bancorp for its significant assets and liabilities 

measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 Available-for-sale a
nd trading securities 
Where quoted prices are available in an active market, 

securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation 

hierarchy. Level 1 securities include government bonds 

and exchange traded equities. If quoted market prices are 
not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing 

models, quoted prices of securities with similar 

characteristics, or discounted cash flows. Examples of  
 
such instruments, which are classified within Level 2 of 

the valuation hierarchy, in
clude agency and non-agency 
mortgage-backed securities, ot
her asset-backed securities, 
obligations of U.S. Government sponsored agencies, and 

corporate and municipal bonds. Agency mortgage-backed 

securities, obligations of U.S. Government sponsored 

agencies, and corporate and municipal bonds are generally 
valued using a market a
pproach based on observable 
prices of securities with similar characteristics. Non-
agency mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed 

securities are generally valued using an income approach 

based on discounted cash flows, incorporating 
prepayment speeds, performance of underlying collateral 

and specific tranche-level attributes. In certain cases where 

there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs 
to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of 
the valuation hierarchy. Tradin
g securities classified as 
Level 3 consist of auction rate securities. Due to the 
illiquidity in the market for these types of securities, the 

Bancorp measures fair value using a discount rate based 
on the assumed holding period. 

 
Residential mortgage loans held for sale and held for 
investment 
For residential mortgage loans held for sale, fair value is 

estimated based upon mortgage
-backed securities prices 
and spreads to those prices or, for certain ARM loans, 
discounted cash flow models that may incorporate the 

anticipated portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-

backed securities with similar collateral, and market 

conditions. The anticipated portfolio composition 
includes the effect of interest rate spreads and discount 
rates due to loan characteristics such as the state in which 
the loan was originated, the loan amount and the ARM 

margin. Residential mortgage loans held for sale that are 

valued based on mortgage-backed securities prices are 

classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as the 

valuation is based on external pricing for similar 

instruments. ARM loans classified as held for sale are also 
classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy due to 
the use of observable inputs in
 the discounted cash flow model. These observable inputs include interest rate 

spreads from agency mortgage-backed securities market 

rates and observable discount rates. For residential 

mortgage loans reclassified from held for sale to held for 
investment, the fair value estimation is based primarily on 

the underlying collateral values
. Therefore, these loans are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Derivatives 

Exchange-traded derivatives valued using quoted prices 

and certain over-the-counter derivatives valued using 

active bids are classified within Level 1 of the valuation 

hierarchy. Most of the Bancorp™s derivative contracts are 
valued using discounted cash flow or other models that 

incorporate current market interest rates, credit spreads 

assigned to the derivative counterparties, and other market 

parameters and, therefore, are classified within Level 2 of 
the valuation hierarchy. Such derivatives include basic and 
structured interest rate swaps and options. Derivatives 
that are valued based upon models with significant 

unobservable market paramete
rs are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. At December 31, 2011, 

derivatives classified as Level 3, which are valued using an 

option-pricing model containing unobservable inputs, 

consisted primarily of warrants and put rights associated 
with the sale of Vantiv Holding, LLC and a total return 
swap associated with the Bancorp™s sale of its Visa, Inc. 

Class B shares. Level 3 derivatives also include interest 

rate lock commitments, which utilize internally generated 

loan closing rate assumptions as a significant unobservable 
input in the valuation process. 

 In addition to the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on 
a recurring basis, the Bancorp measures servicing rights, certain 

loans and long-lived assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 
Refer to Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

for further information on fair value measurements.  

 Goodwill
 Business combinations entered into 
by the Bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be 
tested for impairment at the Bancorp™s reporting unit level on an 
annual basis, which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more 

frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be 
impairment. The Bancorp has determined that its segments qualify 
as reporting units under U.S. GAAP. Impairment exists when a 

reporting unit™s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair 

value, which is determined through a two-step impairment test. The 
first step (Step 1) compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its 
carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step (Step 2) of the 

goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the impairment 

loss amount, if any. 
The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be 
received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between 

market participants at the measurement date. Since none of the 

Bancorp™s reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting 
unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the 
Bancorp™s stock price. To determine the fair value of a reporting 

unit, the Bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the 

reporting unit™s forecasted cash 
flows (including a terminal value 
approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the 

forecast) and the reporting unit™s estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Additionally, the 
Bancorp determines its market 
capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the 
Bancorp's stock during the mont
h including the measurement date, incorporating an additional cont
rol premium, and compares this 
market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of 

the Bancorp's reporting units in order to corroborate the results of 

the income approach.  
When required to perform Step 2, the Bancorp compares the 
implied fair value of a reporting unit™s goodwill with the carrying 

amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied 
fair value, an impairment loss e
qual to that excess amount is 
recognized. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the 
carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed even if the 

fair value of the reporting unit recovers. During Step 2, the Bancorp determines the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the 

reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
24     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 any unrecognized intangible assets) 
as if the reporting unit had been 
acquired in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of 
the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and 

liabilities is the implied fair v
alue of goodwill. This assignment 
process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for 

impairment. The Bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of 

recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if appropriate), 

nor recognize previously unrecogn
ized intangible assets in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of this assignment 

process. Refer to Note 9 of th
e Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further information regarding the Bancorp™s 

goodwill.

      Fifth Third Bancorp     25 
 RISK FACTORS The risks listed below present risks that could have a material 
impact on the Bancorp™s financial condition, the results of its 
operations, or its business.  
 RISKS RELATING TO ECONOMIC AND MARKET 
CONDITIONS 

 Weakness in the economy and in the real estate market, 
including specific weakness within Fifth Third™s geographic 
footprint, has adversely affected Fifth Third and may continue 
to adversely affect Fifth Third. 
If the strength of the U.S. economy in general or the strength of the 

local economies in which Fifth Third conducts operations declines 

or does not improve in a reasonable 
time frame, this could result in, 
among other things, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced 

demand for credit, including a resultant effect on Fifth Third™s loan 

portfolio and ALLL and in the receipt of lower proceeds from the 

sale of loans and foreclosed properties. A significant portion of 
Fifth Third™s residential mortgage and commercial real estate loan 
portfolios are comprised of borrowers in Michigan, Northern Ohio 
and Florida, which markets have been particularly adversely affected 

by job losses, declines in real estate value, declines in home sale 

volumes, and declines in new home building. These factors could 

result in higher delinquencies, greater charge-offs and increased losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate in future periods, which 

could materially adversely affect Fifth Third™s financial condition 
and results of operations.  Changes in interest rates could 
affect Fifth Third™s income and 
cash flows. Fifth Third™s income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the 

difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning 

assets such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates 

paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. 
These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond 
Fifth Third™s control, including general economic conditions and the 

policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies (in 

particular, the FRB). Changes in monetary policy, including changes 

in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the 
prepayment speed of loans, the purchase of investments, the 

generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and 

investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of 
funding. The impact of these changes may be magnified if Fifth 
Third does not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of its assets 

and liabilities to changes in market 
interest rates. Fluctuations in 
these areas may adversely affect Fifth Third and its shareholders. 

 Changes and trends in the capi
tal markets may affect Fifth 
Third™s income and cash flows. Fifth Third enters into and m
aintains trading and investment 
positions in the capital market
s on its own behalf and manages 
investment positions on behalf of its customers. These investment 

positions include derivative financial instruments. The revenues and 

profits Fifth Third derives from ma
naging proprietary and customer 
trading and investment positions are dependent on market prices. 

Market changes and trends may result in a decline in investment 
advisory revenue or investment or trading losses that may materially 

affect Fifth Third. Losses on beh
alf of its customers could expose 
Fifth Third to litigation, credit risks or loss of revenue from those 

customers. Additionally, substantial 
losses in Fifth Third™s trading and investment positions could lead to a loss with respect to those 

investments and may adversely affect cash flows and funding costs. 
  The removal or reduction in stimulus activities sponsored by 
the Federal Government and its agents may have a negative 
impact on Fifth Third™s results and operations. 
The Federal Government has intervened in an unprecedented 

manner to stimulate economic grow
th. The expiration or rescission 
of any of these programs may have an adverse impact on Fifth 

Third™s operating results by increasing interest rates, increasing the 

cost of funding, and reducing the demand for loan products, 

including mortgage loans. 
 Problems encountered by financial institutions larger than or 
similar to Fifth Third could adversely affect financial markets 
generally and have indirect adverse effects on Fifth Third.  
 The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be 

closely interrelated as a result of 
credit, trading, clearing or other 
relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, 
or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to 

significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or 
defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as 
ﬁsystemic riskﬂ and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, 

such as clearing agencies, clearing
 houses, banks, securities firms 
and exchanges, with which the Bancorp interacts on a daily basis, 

and therefore could adversely affect Fifth Third. 

 Fifth Third™s stock price is volatile. 
Fifth Third™s stock price has been volatile in the past and several 
factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. 
These factors include: 
 Actual or anticipated variations in earnings; 
 Changes in analysts™ recommendations or projections; 
 Fifth Third™s announcements of developments related to 
its businesses; 
 Operating and stock performance of other companies 

deemed to be peers;  
 Actions by government regulators; 
 New technology used or services offered by traditional 

and non-traditional competitors 
 News reports of trends, concerns and other issues related 

to the financial services industry  Natural disasters 
 Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism 

or military conflicts.  The price for shares of Fifth Third™s common stock may fluctuate 

significantly in the future, and thes
e fluctuations may be unrelated to 
Fifth Third™s performance. General market price declines or market 
volatility in the future could advers
ely affect the price for shares of 
Fifth Third™s common stock, and the current market price of such 
shares may not be indicative
 of future market prices.  
RISKS RELATING TO FIFTH THIRD™S GENERAL 

BUSINESS 
 Deteriorating credit quality, particularly in real estate loans, 
has adversely impacted Fifth Third and may continue to 
adversely impact Fifth Third. 
When Fifth Third lends money or commits to lend money the 

Bancorp incurs credit risk or the risk of losses if borrowers do not 

repay their loans. The credit performance of the loan portfolios 

significantly affects the Bancorp™s 
financial results and condition. If 
the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more 
customers may have difficulty in 
repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and 

reserves for credit losses. Fifth Third reserves for credit losses by 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
26     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 establishing reserves through a charge to earnings. The amount of 
these reserves is based on Fifth Third™s assessment of credit losses 

inherent in the loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The process for determining the amount of the 
allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded 
commitments is critical to Fifth Third™s financial results and 
condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments 

about the environment, including analysis of economic or market 

conditions that might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their 

loans. Fifth Third might underestimate the credit losses inherent in its 
loan portfolio and have credit losses in excess of the amount 
reserved. Fifth Third might increase the reserve because of changing 
economic conditions, including falling home prices or higher 

unemployment, or other factors such as changes in borrower™s 

behavior. As an example, borrowers may "strategically default," or 

discontinue making payments on their real estate-secured loans if 

the value of the real estate is less than what they owe, even if they 
are still financially able to make the payments.  
Fifth Third believes that both the allowance for loan and lease 
losses and reserve for unfunded commitments are adequate to cover 

inherent losses at December 31, 2011; however, there is no 

assurance that they will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, 

especially if housing and employment conditions worsen. In the 

event of significant deterioration in economic conditions, Fifth 

Third may be required to build rese
rves in future periods, which 
would reduce earnings.  
For more information, refer to the "Risk Management - Credit 
Risk Management," "Critical Acco
unting Policies - Allowance for Loan and Leases," and ﬁReserve for Unfunded Commitmentsﬂ of 

the MD&A.  
 Fifth Third must maintain adequate sources of funding and 
liquidity. 
Fifth Third must maintain adequa
te funding sources in the normal 
course of business to support it
s operations and fund outstanding 
liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations.  Fifth Third 

primarily relies on bank deposits to
 be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans Fifth Third makes and the operations of 

Fifth Third™s business. Core customer deposits, which include 

transaction deposits and other time deposits, have historically 

provided Fifth Third with a sizeable source of relatively stable and 

low-cost funds (average core depos
its funded 71% of average total 
assets at December 31, 2011). In 
addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include investments in the securities portfolio, Fifth Third™s ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets 

and to pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through 

the FHLB and the FRB, and Fifth Th
ird™s ability to raise funds in 
domestic and international money and capital markets. Fifth Third™s liquidity and ability to fund and run the business 
could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and 

factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and 
volatility or a lack of market or
 customer confidence in financial 
markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial 
crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of customer 

deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access 

capital markets on favorable terms.  
Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely 
affect Fifth Third™s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or 

customer confidence in Fifth Third or negative news about Fifth 
Third or the financial services industry generally which also may 
result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to 

access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to 

alternative investments;  inability to sell or securitize loans or other 

assets, and reductions in one or more
 of Fifth Third™s credit ratings. A reduced credit rating could adversely affect Fifth Third™s ability to 

borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and 
could cause creditors and business 
counterparties to raise collateral 
requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect Fifth 

Third™s ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and 

factors may be caused by events over which Fifth Third has little or 
no control such as what occurred during the financial crisis. While 
market conditions have stabilized and, in many cases, improved, 
there can be no assura
nce that significant disruption and volatility in 
the financial markets will not occur in the future.  
Other material adverse effects could include a reduction in 
Fifth Third™s credit ratings resulting from a further decrease in the 

probability of government support for large financial institutions 

such as Fifth Third assumed by the ratings agencies in their current 
credit ratings. If Fifth Third is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if Fifth Third suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise 

fails to manage liquidity effectively, liquidity, operating margins, 

financial results and condition may be materially adversely affected. 

As Fifth Third did during the financial crisis, it may also need to 

raise additional capital through th
e issuance of stock, which could 
dilute the ownership of existing 
stockholders, or reduce or even 
eliminate common stock dividends to preserve capital.  Fifth Third may have more credit 
risk and higher credit losses 
to the extent loans are concentrated by location of the 
borrower or collateral. 
Fifth Third™s credit risk and credit losses can increase if its loans are 

concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities 
or to borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or 

disproportionately affected by 
economic or market conditions. Deterioration in economic conditions, housing conditions and real estate values in these states an
d generally across the country could result in materially higher credit losses. 

 Bankruptcy laws may be chan
ged to allow mortgage ﬁcram-
downs,ﬂ or court-ordered modifications to mortgage loans 
including the reduction of principal balances. 
Under current bankruptcy laws, cour
ts cannot force a modification 
of mortgage and home equity loans secured by primary residences. 

In response to the financial crises, 
legislation has been proposed to 
allow mortgage loan ﬁcram-downs,ﬂ which would empower courts 

to modify the terms of mortgage and home equity loans including a 

reduction in the principal amount to reflect lower underlying 

property values. This could result in writing down the balance of 
mortgage and home equity loans to 
reflect their lower loan values. 
There is also risk that home equity loans in a second lien position 

(i.e. behind a mortgage) could experience significantly higher losses 

to the extent they became unsecured as a result of a cram-down. 

The availability of principal reduct
ions or other modifications to mortgage loan terms could make bankruptcy a more attractive 

option for troubled borrowers, le
ading to increased bankruptcy filings and accelerated defaults.    Fifth Third may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or 
reimburse investors and others as a result of breaches in 
contractual representations and warranties. 
Fifth Third sells residential mort
gage loans to various parties, 
including GSEs and other financial institutions that purchase 
mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. Fifth Third may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, indemnify the 
securitization trust, investor 
or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or in
surer for credit losses incurred on 
loans in the event of a breach of contractual representations or 

warranties that is not remedied within
 a period (usually 90 days or 

less) after Fifth Third receives not
ice of the breach. Contracts for 
mortgage loan sales to the GSEs include various types of specific 

remedies and penalties that could be applied to inadequate 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     27 
 responses to repurchase requests. If economic conditions and the 
housing market do not recover or
 future investor repurchase 

demand and success at appealing repurchase requests differ from 

past experience, Fifth Third could continue to have increased 
repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on repurchases, 
requiring material additions to the repurchase reserve.  

 If Fifth Third does not adjust to rapid changes in the financial 
services industry, its financial performance may suffer. 
Fifth Third™s ability to deliver strong financial performance and 

returns on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the 
needs and demands of its customers. In addition to the challenge of 
competing against other banks in attracting and retaining customers 

for traditional banking services, Fifth Third™s competitors also 
include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment 

advisors, specialty finance and insurance companies who seek to 

offer one-stop financial services that
 may include services that banks 
have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past 

or may not be currently able or allowed to offer. This increasingly 
competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in 
regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, as 
well as the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial 

service providers. 

 If Fifth Third is unable to grow its deposits, it may be subject 
to paying higher funding costs. 
The total amount that Fifth Third pays for funding costs is 
dependent, in part, on Fifth Third™s ability to grow its deposits. If 
Fifth Third is unable to sufficiently grow its deposits, it may be 

subject to paying higher funding costs.  Fifth Third competes with 

banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If 
competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, Fifth Third™s 
funding costs may increase, either because Fifth Third raises rates to 

avoid losing deposits or because 
Fifth Third loses deposits and must 
rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs 
reduce our net interest margin and net interest income. Fifth Third™s bank customers could take their mon
ey out of the bank and put it in 
alternative investments, causing Fi
fth Third to lose a lower cost 
source of funding. Checking and savings account balances and other 
forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive 

alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a 

better risk/return tradeoff.   The Bancorp™s ability to r
eceive dividends from its 
subsidiaries accounts for most of its revenue and could affect 
its liquidity and ability to pay dividends. 
  Fifth Third Bancorp is a separate and distinct legal entity from its 

subsidiaries. Fifth Third Bancorp typically receives substantially all 

of its revenue from dividends from
 its subsidiaries. These dividends 
are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on Fifth Third 

Bancorp™s stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various 
federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory 
expectations, limit the amount of dividends that the Bancorp™s 

banking subsidiary and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. Also, 

Fifth Third Bancorp™s right to participate in a distribution of assets 

upon a subsidiary™s liquidation or 
reorganization is subject to the 
prior claims of that subsidiary™s creditors. Limitations on the 

Bancorp™s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could 

have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay 
dividends on stock or interest and principal on its debt. 
 The financial services industry
 is highly competitive and 
creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect Fifth 
Third™s revenue and profitability.  
 The financial services industry in which Fifth Third operates is 

highly competitive. Fifth Third competes not only with commercial 
banks, but also with insurance 
companies, mutual funds, hedge 
funds, and other companies offering
 financial services in the U.S., globally and over the internet. Fifth Third competes on the basis of 

several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue 
generation, products, services, tr
ansaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, 
certain sectors of the financial 
services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions 
involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired 
by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in 

Fifth Third™s competitors gaining greater capital and other 

resources, such as a broader range of products and services and 

geographic diversity. Fifth Third may experience pricing pressures 
as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to 
increase market share by reducing prices. 

 Fifth Third and/or the holders of its securities could be 
adversely affected by unfavorabl
e ratings from rating agencies. 
 Fifth Third™s ability to access the capital markets is important to its 

overall funding profile. This access is affected by the ratings 

assigned by rating agencies to Fifth Third, certain of its subsidiaries and particular classes of securities 
they issue. The interest rates that Fifth Third pays on its securities are also influenced by, among 

other things, the credit ratings that it, its subsidiaries and/or its 

securities receive from recognized
 rating agencies. A downgrade to Fifth Third or its subsidiaries™ credit rating could affect its ability to 
access the capital markets, increase its borrowing costs and 

negatively impact its profitability. A ratings downgrade to Fifth 

Third, its subsidiaries or their securities could also create obligations 
or liabilities to Fifth Third under the terms of its outstanding 

securities that could increase Fifth Third™s costs or otherwise have a 

negative effect on its results of 
operations or financial condition. 
Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular 

security issued by Fifth Third or
 its subsidiaries could negatively 
affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities 

and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.  
 Fifth Third could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled 
personnel. 
Fifth Third™s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract 

and retain key individuals. Competition for qualified candidates in 

the activities and markets that Fift
h Third serves is great and Fifth 
Third may not be able to hire these candidates and retain them. If 

Fifth Third is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, Fifth 

Third may be unable to execute 
its business strategies and may 
suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations and financial 

condition. In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued joint 
guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a 

banking organization™s incentive compensation policies do not 

encourage imprudent risk taking an
d are consistent with the safety 
and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act 

requires those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to 
require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain 
compensation arrangements. The federal banking agencies and SEC 

proposed such rules in April 2011. If Fifth Third is unable to attract 

and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to 

maintain its competitive position, 
or if compensation costs required 
to attract and retain employees become more expensive, Fifth 

Third™s performance, including it
s competitive position, could be 
materially adversely affected.  
 Fifth Third™s mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from 
quarter to quarter. 
Fifth Third earns revenue from the fees it receives for originating 
mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. When rates rise, 

the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall, reducing the revenue 

Fifth Third receives from loan originations. At the same time, 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
28     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 revenue from MSRs can increase through increases in fair value. 
When rates fall, mortgage originations tend to increase and the value 

of MSRs tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. 

Even though the origination of mortgage loans can act as a ﬁnatural 
hedge,ﬂ the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For 
example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair 

value of residential MSRs is immediate, but any offsetting revenue 

benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to the new 

loans would accrue over time. It is also possible that, because of the 

recession and deteriorating housing 
market, even if interest rates were to fall, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in 

mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates.  
     Fifth Third typically uses derivatives and other instruments to 

hedge its mortgage banking interest rate risk. Fifth Third generally 

does not hedge all of its risks, and the fact that Fifth Third attempts 

to hedge any of the risks does not mean Fifth Third will be 

successful. Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated 

models and constant monitoring. Fifth Third may use hedging 

instruments tied to U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR or Eurodollars that 
may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. 

Fifth Third could incur significant losses from its hedging activities. 
There may be periods where Fifth Third elects not to use derivatives 

and other instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk.  

 Changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of MSRs. 
Fifth Third acquires MSRs when it
 keeps the servicing rights after the sale or securitization of the loans that have been originated or 
when it purchases the servicing rights to mortgage loans originated 
by other lenders. Fifth Third initially measures all residential MSRs 

at fair value and subsequently am
ortizes the MSRs in proportion to, 

and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. Fair value is 

the present value of estimated future net servicing income, 

calculated based on a number of variables, including assumptions 

about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. Servicing rights 

are assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with 
temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance 
and permanent impairment recogniz
ed through a write-off of the 
servicing asset and related valuation allowance. 
Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions 
and thus fair value. When interest
 rates fall, borrowers are usually 
more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a 
lower rate. As the likelihood of pr
epayment increases, the fair value 
of MSRs can decrease. Each quarter Fifth Third evaluates the fair 
value of MSRs, and decreases in fair value below amortized cost 
reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs. 
 The preparation of Fifth Third™s financial statements requires 
the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. 
The preparation of consolidated fi
nancial statements in conformity 
with U.S. GAAP requires managemen
t to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Two of Fifth Third™s most 
critical estimates are the level of the ALLL and the valuation of 
MSRs. Due to the uncertainty of estimates involved, Fifth Third 

may have to significantly increase
 the ALLL and/or sustain credit 
losses that are significantly higher
 than the provided allowance and 
could recognize a significant provision for impairment of its MSRs. If Fifth Third™s ALLL is not adequate, Fifth Third™s business, 

financial condition, including its liquidity and capital, and results of 

operations could be materially adversely affected.  
Fifth Third regularly reviews its litigation reserves for adequacy 
considering its litigation risks and probability of incurring losses 

related to litigation. However, Fifth Third cannot be certain that its 

current litigation reserves will be 
adequate over time to cover its 
losses in litigation due to higher than anticipated settlement costs, 
prolonged litigation, adverse judgments, or other factors that are 

largely outside of Fifth Third™s control. If Fifth Third™s litigation 
reserves are not adequate, Fifth Third™s business, financial 

condition, including its liquidity and capital, and results of 

operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, in 

the future, Fifth Third may increase its litigation reserves, which 
could have a material adverse effect on its capital and results of 
operations. 
 Changes in accounting standards could impact Fifth Third™s 
reported earnings and financial condition. 
The accounting standard setters, including the FASB, the SEC and 

other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting 

and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Fifth Third™s 
consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to 
predict and can materially impact how Fifth Third records and 

reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some 

cases, Fifth Third could be required to apply a new or revised 

standard retroactively, which would result in the recasting of Fifth 

Third™s prior period financial statements. 

 Future acquisitions may dilute current shareholders™ 
ownership of Fifth Third and may cause Fifth Third to 
become more susceptible to adverse economic events. 
Future business acquisitions could be material to Fifth Third and it 

may issue additional shares of st
ock to pay for those acquisitions, 
which would dilute current shareholders™ ownership interests. 

Acquisitions also could require Fifth Third to use substantial cash or 

other liquid assets or to incur debt. In those events, Fifth Third 

could become more susceptible to economic downturns and 
competitive pressures. 
 Difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities 
with Fifth Third™s own operations may prevent Fifth Third 
from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions. 
Inherent uncertainties exist when 
integrating the operations of an acquired entity. Fifth Third may not be able to fully achieve its 

strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an 
acquisition. In addition, the markets and industries in which Fifth 
Third and its potential acquisition targets operate are highly 

competitive. Fifth Third may lose customers or the customers of 

acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. Future acquisition and 

integration activities may require Fifth Third to devote substantial 

time and resources and as a result Fifth Third may not be able to 

pursue other business opportunities.   
After completing an acquisition, Fifth Third may find certain 
items are not accounted for properl
y in accordance with financial 
accounting and reporting standards. Fifth Third may also not realize 

the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial 

results pertaining to the acquired entity. For example, Fifth Third 

could experience higher charge o
ffs than originally anticipated 
related to the acquired loan portfolio. 
 Fifth Third may sell or consider selling one or more of its 
businesses. Should it determine to sell such a business, it may 
not be able to generate gains on sale or related increase in 
shareholders™ equity commensurate with desirable levels. 
Moreover, if Fifth Third sold 
such businesses, the loss of 
income could have an adverse effect on its earnings and future 
growth. 
Fifth Third owns several non-strategic businesses that are not 

significantly synergistic with its core financial services businesses. Fifth Third has, from time to time, considered the sale of such 

businesses. If it were to determine to sell such businesses, Fifth 

Third would be subject to market forces that may make completion 

of a sale unsuccessful or may not be able to do so within a desirable 

time frame. If Fifth Third were to complete the sale of non-core 

businesses, it would suffer the loss of income from the sold 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     29 
 businesses, and such loss of income could have an adverse effect on 
its future earnings and growth. 
 Fifth Third relies on its system
s and certain service providers, 
and certain failures could materially adversely affect 
operations. 
Fifth Third collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by 

utilizing computer systems and 
telecommunications networks 
operated by both Fifth Third and third party service providers. Fifth 

Third has security, backup and recove
ry systems in place, as well as 
a business continuity plan to ensure the system will not be 

inoperable. Fifth Third also has s
ecurity to prevent unauthorized 
access to the system. In addition, Fifth Third requires its third party 

service providers to maintain similar controls. However, Fifth Third 

cannot be certain that the measures will be successful. A security 

breach in the system and loss of 
confidential information such as credit card numbers and related information could result in losing 

the customers™ confidence and thus the loss of their business as well 

as additional significant costs for 
privacy monitoring activities.  Fifth Third™s necessary dependence upon automated systems to 
record and process its transaction volume poses the risk that 

technical system flaws or employee errors, tampering or 

manipulation of those systems w
ill result in losses and may be 
difficult to detect. Fifth Third may 
also be subject to disruptions of 
its operating systems arising from events that are beyond its control 

(for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages). Fifth Third is further exposed to the risk that its third 

party service providers may be unab
le to fulfill their contractual 
obligations (or will be subject to
 the same risk of fraud or 
operational errors as Fifth Third). These disruptions may interfere 

with service to Fifth Third™s customers and result in a financial loss 
or liability. 
 Fifth Third is exposed to operational and reputational risk. 
Fifth Third is exposed to many types of operational risk, including 

reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, environmental risks 
from its properties, the risk of fraud or theft by employees, 
customers or outsiders, unauthor
ized transactions by employees, 
operating system disruptions or operational errors. 
 Negative public opinion can result from Fifth Third™s actual or 
alleged conduct in activities, such as lending practices, data security, 

corporate governance and acquisitions, and may damage Fifth 

Third™s reputation. Negative public opinion has been observed 

through the media coverage of public protests and in relation to banks participating in the U.S. Treasury™s TARP program, in which 
Fifth Third was a participant. Additionally, actions taken by 

government regulators and commu
nity organizations may also 
damage Fifth Third™s reputation. This negative public opinion can 

adversely affect Fifth Third™s ability to attract and keep customers 

and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action.  
 The results of Vantiv Holding, LLC could have a negative 
impact on Fifth Third™s operating results and financial 
condition. 
During the second quarter of 2009, Fifth Third sold an approximate 

51% interest in its processing business, Vantiv Holding, LLC 

(formerly Fifth Third Processing So
lutions) to Advent International. 

Based on Fifth Third™s current owne
rship share in Vantiv Holding, 
LLC, of approximately 49%, Vantiv
 Holding, LLC is accounted for 
under the equity method and is not consolidated. Poor operating 
results of Vantiv Holding, LLC could negatively affect the operating 
results of Fifth Third. In connection with the sale, Fifth Third 
provided Advent International with certain put rights that are 

exercisable in the event of three unlikely circumstances. The 

exercise of the put rights would result in Vantiv Holding, LLC 
becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Fifth Third. As a result, 

Vantiv Holding, LLC would be consolidated and would subject 
Fifth Third to the risks inherent in integrating a business. 
Additionally, such a change in the 
accounting treatment for Vantiv 

Holding, LLC may adversely impact
 Fifth Third™s capital. Fifth 
Third participates in a multi lender 
credit facility to Vantiv Holding, 
LLC and repayment of these loans is contingent on future cash 

flows to Vantiv Holding, LLC.  
 Fifth Third™s interests in Vant
iv Holding, LLC may change 
and the potential effects of those changes are uncertain. 
In November 2011, Vantiv Holding,
 LLC, through its affiliated 

entity, Vantiv Inc., filed a registration statement with the SEC which 

contemplates an IPO of shares of Class A Common Stock of 
Vantiv Inc. The IPO contemplates a corporate reorganization of 
Vantiv Inc., which reorganization could substantially change Fifth 
Third™s interests in Vantiv Holdin
g, LLC. The potential effects on 
Fifth Third may include, without 
limitation, changes in (i) the 
Vantiv entities in which Fifth Third holds equity ownership, (ii) the 

type of equity interests owned by Fifth Third in those entities, (iii) 

Fifth Third™s overall ownership percentage interests in those entities, 

due to any sale by Fifth Third of an
y of its existing equity interests 
in Vantiv Holding, LLC  or its 
ownership percentage is diluted through any sale of additional equity by Vantiv Holding, LLC in or 
in connection with the IPO,  and (iv) Fifth Third™s voting and 

corporate governance rights. If Fifth Third sells any of its 

ownership interests in Vantiv Holding, LLC in connection with the 

Vantiv Inc. IPO, the amount of
 such sales have not yet been determined and the price at which such sales would be effected 
cannot be determined unless and until the IPO is completed.  Fifth 
Third cannot predict whether the Vantiv Inc. IPO will be completed 
and/or the final terms and conditi
ons thereof.  Accordingly, the potential impacts on Fifth Third of a Vantiv Inc. IPO are uncertain.    

 Weather related events or other natural disasters may have an 
effect on the performance of Fifth Third™s loan portfolios, 
especially in its coastal markets, thereby adversely impacting 
its results of operations. 
Fifth Third™s footprint stretches from the upper Midwestern to 

lower Southeastern regions of the United States. This area has 

experienced weather events includ
ing hurricanes and other natural 
disasters. The nature and level of these events and the impact of 

global climate change upon their frequency and severity cannot be 

predicted. If large scale events o
ccur, they may significantly impact 
its loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral as 

well as impairing its borrower™s 
ability to repay their loans.  
RISKS RELATED TO THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY 

ENVIRONMENT 

 As a regulated entity, the Bancor
p is subject to certain capital 
requirements that may limit its operations and potential 
growth.  
 The Bancorp is a bank holding company and a financial holding 
company. As such, it is subject to
 the comprehensive, consolidated 
supervision and regulation of the FRB, including risk-based and 
leverage capital requirements. The Bancorp must maintain certain 

risk-based and leverage capital ratios as required by its banking 

regulators and which can change depending upon general economic 

conditions and the Bancorp™s partic
ular condition, risk profile and growth plans. Compliance with th
e capital requirements, including 
leverage ratios, may limit operations that require the intensive use of 
capital and could adversely affect the Bancorp™s ability to expand or 
maintain present business levels. The Bancorp™s banking subsidiary must remain well-capitalized, 
well-managed and maintain at least 
a ﬁSatisfactoryﬂ CRA rating for 
the Bancorp to retain its status 
as a financial holding company. 
Failure to meet these requirements could result in the FRB placing 
limitations or conditions on the 
Bancorp™s activities (and the 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
30     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 commencement of new activities) and could ultimately result in the 
loss of financial holding company status. In addition, failure by the 
Bancorp™s banking subsidiary to meet applicable capital guidelines 
could subject the bank to a 
variety of enforcement remedies 
available to the federal regulat
ory authorities. These include 
limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the 

regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital, and the 

termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.  

 Fifth Third™s business, financial condition and results of 
operations could be adversely affected by new or changed 
regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are 
applied by regulatory authorities. 
 Current economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, 
have resulted in government regulatory agencies placing increased 

focus on and scrutiny of the financial services industry. The U.S. 
government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding 

to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis, by 

introducing various actions and passing legislations such as the 

Dodd Frank Act. Such programs and legislation subject Fifth Third 
and other financial institutions to restrictions, oversight and/or 
costs that may have an impact on Fifth Third™s business, financial 

condition, results of operations or
 the price of its common stock.  
New proposals for legislation and regulations continue to be 
introduced that could further substantially increase regulation of the 

financial services industry. Fifth Third cannot predict whether any 

pending or future legislation will 
be adopted or the substance and 

impact of any such new legislation on Fifth Third. Additional 
regulation could affect Fifth Third in a substantial way and could 
have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and 

results of operations.   
 Fifth Third is subject to various regulatory requirements that 
limit its operations and potential growth. 
Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety 
and soundness of insured depository institutions and their holding 
companies, the FRB, the CFPB,  an
d the Ohio Division of Financial 
Institutions have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions 
by Fifth Third and its banking subsidiary. Fifth Third and its 
banking subsidiary are subject to such supervisory authority and, 

more generally, must, in certain 
instances, obtain prior regulatory 
approval before engaging in certain 
activities or corporate decisions. 
There can be no assurance that such approvals, if required, would 

be forthcoming or that such approvals would be granted in a timely 
manner. Failure to receive any such approval, if required, could limit 
or impair Fifth Third™s operations, restrict its growth and/or affect 

its dividend policy. Such actions and activities subject to prior 
approval include, but are not limited 
to, increasing dividends paid by Fifth Third or its banking subsidiary, entering into a merger or 

acquisition transaction, acquiring 
or establishing new branches, and 
entering into certain new businesses. 
 In addition, Fifth Third, as well as other financial institutions 
more generally, have recently been subjected to increased scrutiny 

from regulatory authorities stemming from broader systemic 

regulatory concerns, including with 
respect to stress testing, capital 
levels, asset quality, provisioning and other prudential matters, 
arising as a result of the recent fi
nancial crisis and efforts to ensure 
that financial institutions take steps to improve their risk 

management and prevent future crises.  
In some cases, regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions 
that may not be publicly disclosed, which restrict or limit a financial 

institution. Finally, as part of Fifth Third™s regular examination 

process, Fifth Third™s and its 
banking subsidiary™s respective 

regulators may advise it and its banking subsidiary to operate under 

various restrictions as a prudential matter. Such supervisory actions 

or restrictions, if and in whatever manner imposed, could have a 
material adverse effect on Fifth Third™s business and results of 

operations and may not be publicly disclosed. 

 Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become involved 
from time to time in information-gathering requests, 
investigations and proceedings by government and self-
regulatory agencies which may lead to adverse consequences. 
Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become involved from 

time to time in information-gathering requests, reviews, 

investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by 

government and self-regulatory agencies, including the SEC, 

regarding their respective businesse
s. Such matters may result in 
material adverse consequences, incl
uding without limitation, adverse 
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other actions, 

amendments and/or restatements of Fifth Third™s SEC filings 

and/or financial statements, as app
licable, and/or determinations of material weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures. The 

SEC is investigating and has made several requests for information, 

including by subpoena, concerning issues which Fifth Third 

understands relate to accounting and reporting matters involving 
certain of its commercial loans. This could lead to an enforcement 
proceeding by the SEC which, in turn, may result in one or more 
such material adverse consequences. 

 Deposit insurance premiums levied against Fifth Third may 
increase if the number of bank failures increase or the cost of 
resolving failed banks increases.  
The FDIC maintains a DIF to resolve the cost of bank failures. The 
DIF is funded by fees assessed 
on insured depository institutions 
including Fifth Third. The magnitude and cost of resolving an 
increased number of bank failures have reduced the DIF. Future 

deposit premiums paid by Fifth Third depend on the level of the 
DIF and the magnitude and cost of future bank failures. Fifth Third 

also may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums 

because market developments have
 significantly depleted the DIF of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.  
 Legislative or regulatory compliance, changes or actions or 
significant litigation, could adversely impact Fifth Third or the 
businesses in which Fifth Third is engaged. 
 Fifth Third is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, 

supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its 

operations and limit the businesses in which Fifth Third may 

engage. These laws and regulations may change from time to time 
and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, 
depositors and the deposit insurance funds. The impact of any 

changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory 

agencies may negatively impact Fifth Third or its ability to increase 

the value of its business. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against Fifth Third could cause it to devote 

significant time and resources to de
fending itself and may lead to 
penalties that materially affect Fifth Third and its shareholders. 
Future changes in the laws, including tax laws, or regulations or 
their interpretations or enforcement may also be materially adverse 

to Fifth Third and its shareholders or may require Fifth Third to 

expend significant time and resources to comply with such 

requirements. On July 21, 2010 the President of 
the United States signed into 
law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act will have material 

implications for Fifth Third and the entire financial services 
industry. Among other things it will or potentially could: 
 Result in Fifth Third being subject to enhanced oversight 
and scrutiny as a result of being a bank holding company 
with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets;   
 Result in the appointment of the FDIC as receiver of Fifth 

Third in an orderly liquidation pr
oceeding, if the Secretary of 
the U.S. Treasury, upon recommendation of two-thirds of MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     31 
 the FRB and the FDIC and in consultation with the 
President of the United States, finds Fifth Third to be in 

default or danger of default;  Affect the levels of capital and liquidity with which Fifth 
Third must operate and how it plans capital and liquidity 
levels (including a phased-in elimination of Fifth Third™s 

existing trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital); 
 Subject Fifth Third to new and/or higher fees paid to 

various regulatory entities, in
cluding but not limited to 
deposit insurance fees to the FDIC; 
 Impact Fifth Third™s ability to invest in certain types of 
entities or engage in certain activities;  Impact a number of Fifth Third™s business and risk 

management strategies;  Restrict the revenue that Fifth Third generates from certain 

businesses, including interchange fee revenue generated by 
Fifth Third™s debit and credit card businesses; 
 Subject Fifth Third to a new CFPB, which will have broad rule-making and enforcement authorities; and 
 Subject Fifth Third to oversight and regulation by a new and 

different litigation and regulatory regime. 
 As the Dodd-Frank Act requires that many studies be conducted 

and that hundreds of regulations be written in order to fully 

implement it, the full impact of this legislation on Fifth Third, its 

business strategies and financial performance cannot be known at this time, and may not be known for a number of years. However, 

these impacts are expected to be substantial and some of them are 
likely to adversely affect Fifth Third and its financial performance. 
The extent to which Fifth Third can 
adjust its strategies to offset 
such adverse impacts also is not known at this time. 

 Fifth Third and other financial institutions have been the 
subject of increased litigation which could result in legal 
liability and damage to its reputation.   
Fifth Third and certain of its directors and officers have been 
named from time to time as defendants in various class actions and 
other litigation relating to Fifth Thir
d™s business and activities. Past, 
present and future litigation have included or could include claims 

for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for 

indeterminate amounts of damages. Fifth Third is also involved 

from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings 

(both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory 

agencies regarding its business. These matters also could result in 
adverse judgments, settlements, fines,
 penalties, injunctions or other relief. Like other large financial institutions and companies, Fifth 
Third is also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, 
including non-compliance with policies and improper use or 

disclosure of confidential informat
ion. Substantial legal liability or 
significant regulatory action against Fifth Third could materially 

adversely affect its business, fi
nancial condition or results of 
operations and/or cause significant reputational harm to its 
business. 
 Fifth Third™s ability to pay or increase dividends on its 
common stock or to repurchase its capital stock is restricted. 
Fifth Third™s ability to pay dividend
s or repurchase stock is subject 
to regulatory requirements and the need to meet regulatory 

expectations. MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 
Net Interest Income 
Net interest income is the interest earned on securities, loans and 
leases (including yield-related fees) and other interest-earning assets 
less the interest paid for core deposits (includes transaction deposits 

and other time deposits) and wholes
ale funding (includes certificates 
of deposit $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds 

purchased, short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net 

interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by 

average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the 

difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest 
margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the 
interest income earned on those assets that are funded by 

noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand 

deposits or shareholders™ equity. 
Table 5 presents the components of net interest income, net 
interest margin and net interest rate spread for the years ended 

December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. N
onaccrual loans and leases 
and loans held for sale have been 
included in the average loan and 
lease balances. Average outstanding 
securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses on available-for-

sale securities included in other assets. Table 6 provides the relative 

impact of changes in the balance sheet and changes in interest rates 

on net interest income.  
Net interest income was $3.6 billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Included within net interest 
income are amounts related to the accretion of discounts on 
acquired loans and deposits, primarily
 as a result of acquisitions in 
previous years, which increased ne
t interest income by $40 million 
during 2011 and $68 million during 2010. The original purchase 

accounting discounts reflected the high discount rates in the market 
at the time of the acquisitions; the total loan discounts are being 

accreted into net interest income over the remaining period to 

maturity of the loans acquired. Based upon the remaining period to 
maturity, and excluding the impact of prepayments, the Bancorp 
anticipates recognizing approximat
ely $15 million in additional net interest income during 2012 as a result of the amortization and 

accretion of premiums and discounts on acquired loans and 

deposits.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, net interest income 
was adversely impacted by lower yields on both the commercial and 

consumer loan portfolios partially offset by an increase in average 
consumer loans and a decrease in interest expense compared to the 
year ended December 31, 2010. Yields on the commercial and 

consumer loan portfolio decreased throughout 2011 as the result of 

low interest rates during the year. Average consumer loans increased 

primarily as the result of increases in average residential mortgage 

loans and automobile loans partially 
offset by a decrease in home 
equity loans compared to the 
year ended December 31, 2010. The 
decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of a $3.2 billion 
decrease in average interest bearing liabilities from the year ended 
December 31, 2010, coupled with a 
continued mix shift to lower 
cost core deposits as well as the benefit of lower rates offered on 

savings account balances and other time deposits. The decrease in 

average interest bearing liabilities was the result of migration from 

certificates of deposit into demand deposit accounts due to low 

interest rates during 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2011, 
the net interest rate spread increased to 3.42% from 3.39% in 2010 
as the benefit of a 25 bps decrease in rates on interest bearing 

liabilities was partially offset by a 22 bps decrease in yield on average 

interest earnings assets.   
Net interest margin was 3.66% for the years ended December 
31, 2011 and 2010. Net interest margin was impacted by the 

amortization and accretion of pr
emiums and discounts on acquired loans and deposits that resulted in an increase of 5 bps during 2011 

compared to 7 bps during 2010. Exclusive of these amounts, net 
interest margin increased 2 bps for the year ended December 31, 

2011 compared to the prior year primarily as the result of the 
previously mentioned mix shift to lower cost core deposits during 
2011, an increase in free funding balances and a decrease in average 
interest earnings assets partially 
offset by the previously mentioned 
decrease on the yield of average loans and leases.  
Total average interest-earning assets decreased one percent for 
the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the prior year 

primarily as the result of an 11% 
decrease in the average investment portfolio and a one percent decrea
se in average commercial loans; partially offset by a four percent in
crease in average consumer loans. For more information on the Bancorp™s investment securities 
portfolio and loan and lease portfolio, see the Investment Securities 

and Loan and Lease sections of MD&A.
 Interest income from loans and leases decreased $207 million, 
or five percent, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 

driven primarily by a 32 bps decrease
 in average loan yields partially 
offset by a four percent increase 
in average consumer loans. Yields 
across much of the loan and lease 
portfolio decreased as the result 
of lower interest rates on newly originated loans and a decline in 
interest rates on automobile loans due to increased competition. 

Exclusive of the amortization 
and accretion of premiums and 
discounts on acquired loans, intere
st income from loans and leases 
decreased $179 million compared to the year ended December 31, 

2010. Interest income from investment securities and short-term 

investments decreased $64 million, or 10%, from the prior year 
primarily as the result of a $2.2 billion decrease in the average 
balance and a 16 bps decrease in the average yield of taxable 

securities.    
Average core deposits increased $2
.5 billion, or three percent, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to an 
increase in average demand depos
its and average savings deposits 

partially offset by a decrease in average time deposits. The cost of 
average core deposits decreased to 36 bps for the year ended 
December 31, 2011 compared to 61 bps from the prior year. This 
decrease was primarily the result of
 a mix shift to lower cost core 
deposits as a result of runoff of higher priced CDs combined with a 
24 bps decrease in rates on average savings deposits and a 39 bps 

decrease in rates on average time deposits compared to year ended 

December 31, 2010.  
Interest expense on wholesale funding for the year ended 
December 31, 2011 decreased $38 million, or nine percent, 
compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of a $2.0 billion 
decrease in the average balance partially offset by a 4 bps increase in 

the rate. Refer to the Borrowings section of MD&A for additional 
information on the Bancorp™s changes in average borrowings. 

During the year ended December 31, 2011, wholesale funding 

represented 23% of interest bearing liabilities compared to 25% 

during the prior year. For more information on the Bancorp™s 

interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings 
sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Market Risk 
Management section of MD&A.

 Provision for Loan and Lease Losses 
The Bancorp provides as an expense an amount for probable loan 
and lease losses within the loan and 
lease portfolio that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies 
section. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL to a level 
deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses inherent in the 

portfolio. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged 

against the ALLL. The amount of loans actually removed from the 

Consolidated Balance Sheets is referred to as charge-offs. Net 

charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on 

previously charged-off loans and leases. The provision for loan and lease losses decreased to $423 
million in 2011 compared to $1.5 billion in 2010. The decrease in 

provision expense for 2011 compared to the prior year was due to 

decreases in nonperforming loans and leases, improved delinquency 

metrics in commercial and cons
umer loans and leases, and 
improvement in underlying loss tr
ends. The ALLL declined $749 
million from $3.0 billion at December 31, 2010 to $2.3 billion at 
December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the ALLL as a 

percent of loans and leases decrea
sed to 2.78%, compared to 3.88% 
at December 31, 2010.

losses, including an analysis of loan portfolio composition,

                   Origination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $94 million in 

2011 compared to 2010 primarily as the result of a 26% decrease in 
the profit margin on sold residential mortgage loans due to a 

decrease in interest rates and an ei
ght percent decrease in residential mortgage loan originations compared to 2010. Residential mortgage loan originations decreased to $18.6 billion during 2011 compared 
to $20.3 billion during 2010. The decrease in originations is primarily due to a decrease in refi
nancing activity as many customers 
have taken advantage of the low interest rate environment in prior 

years.   
Net servicing revenue is comprised of gross servicing fees and 
related servicing rights amortization as well as valuation adjustments 

on MSRs and mark-to-market ad
justments on both settled and 
outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments used to 

economically hedge the MSR portfolio. Net servicing revenue 

increased $44 million in 2011 compared to 2010 driven primarily by 

an increase in valuation adjustments and gross servicing fees. The 

net valuation adjustment of $102 million during 2011 included $344 
million in gains from derivatives economically hedging the MSRs 
partially offset by $242 million 
in temporary impairment on the MSR portfolio. The gain in the net valuation adjustment is reflective 

of refinancing activity in recent years that has contributed to 

prepayments being less sensitive to lower mortgage rates due to 

customers taking advantage of lower rates in earlier periods as well 
as the impact of tighter underwriting standards. Additionally, the net 
MSR/hedge position has benefited from the positive carry of the 
hedge and the widening spread between mortgage and swap rates. 
Gross servicing fees increased $13 million in 2011 compared to 

2010 as a result of an increase in 
the size of the Bancorp™s servicing 

portfolio. The Bancorp™s total residential loans serviced as of 

December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $70.6 
billion and $63.2 billion, respectively, with $57.1 billion and $54.2 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. 
Servicing rights are deemed impaired when a borrower™s loan 
rate is distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Impairment on 
servicing rights is reversed when 
the prevailing rates return to a level commensurate with the borrower™s loan rate. Further detail on the 
valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 12 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-

qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk 

associated with changes in the valuation on the MSR portfolio. See 
Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 

more information on the free-standing derivatives used to 

economically hedge the MSR portfolio. 
In addition to the derivative positions used to economically 
hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as 
a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. Net gains on 

sales of these securities were $9 million and $14 million in 2011 and 

2010, respectively, and were recorded in securities gains, net, non-

qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights in the Bancorp™s 

Consolidated Statements of Income.  
 Service charges on deposits 
Service charges on deposits decreased $54 million in 2011 compared 
to 2010. Consumer deposit revenue decreased $59 million in 2011 

compared to 2010 primarily due to the impact of Regulation E and 

new overdraft policies that resulted in a decrease in overdraft 

occurrences. Regulation E became effective on July 1, 2010 for new 

accounts and August 15, 2010 for ex
isting accounts. Regulation E is 
a FRB rule that prohibits financial institutions from charging 

consumers fees for paying overdrafts on ATMs and one-time debit 
card transactions unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the 
overdraft service for those types of transactions.  
Commercial deposit revenue increased $5 million in 2011 
compared to 2010 primarily due to
 an increase in commercial 
account relationships and a decrease
 in earnings credits paid on customer balances as the result of a decrease in the crediting rate 

applied to balances. Commercial customers receive earnings credits 

to offset the fees charged for banking services on their deposit 
accounts such as account maintenance, lockbox, ACH transactions, 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
36     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 wire transfers and other ancillary corporate treasury management 
services. Earnings credits are based on the customer™s average 

balance in qualifying deposits multiplied by the crediting rate. 

Qualifying deposits include demand deposits and interest-bearing 
checking accounts. The Bancorp has a standard crediting rate that is 
adjusted as necessary based on th
e competitive market conditions and changes in short-term interest rates.  
 Investment advisory revenue 
Investment advisory revenue increased $14 million in 2011 

compared to 2010 primarily due to
 improved market performance 
and sales force expansion that resulted in increased brokerage 
activity. As of December 31, 2011, the Bancorp had approximately 
$282 billion in total assets under care and managed $24 billion in 
assets for individuals, corporations
 and not-for-profit organizations. 
  Corporate banking revenue 
Corporate banking revenue decreased $14 million in 2011 compared 

to 2010. The decrease from the prior year was primarily the result of 

decreases in institutional sales, syndication fees, lease remarketing 
fees and international income part
ially offset by an increase in 
business lending fees.  
 
Card and processing revenue 
Card and processing revenue decreased $8 million in 2011 

compared to 2010.  The decrease was the result of an increase in 

costs associated with redemption of cash based reward points and 

the impact of the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act™s debit 
card interchange fee cap in the 
fourth quarter of 2011 partially 
offset by increased debit and credit card transaction volumes.

to one of the Bancorp™s BOLI policies in 2010. Excluding the 

impact of the litigation settlement, other noninterest income was 

relatively flat compared to 2010 as an increase of $64 million in 

losses on the swap associated with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B 

shares, a decrease of $28 million in TSA revenue and a decrease of 

$14 million in the gains on loan sales were offset by increases of $34 

million in gains on the valuation of warrants and put options issued 

as part of the sale of the processing business, $31 million in equity 
method income from the Bancorp™s ownership interest in Vantiv 

Holding, LLC, $15 million in gains from private equity investments 

(recorded in the ﬁotherﬂ caption) and a $12 million reduction in 
losses from fair value adjustments on commercial loans designated 

as held for sale (recorded in the ﬁotherﬂ caption). For additional 
information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of 
Visa, Inc. Class B shares and th
e valuation of warrants and put 

options associated with the sale of
 the processing business, see Note 
27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   

 As part of the sale of the processing business, in 2009, the 

Bancorp entered into a TSA with The processing business that 

resulted in the Bancorp recogniz
ing approximately $21 million and 

$49 million in revenue during 2011 and 2010, respectively, which 
were offset with expense from the servicing agreements recorded in 
noninterest expense.

 Noninterest Expense
 Total noninterest expense decreased $97 million, or three percent, 
in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a decrease in other 

noninterest expense, as discussed below, partially offset by an 
increase in total personnel costs (s
alaries, wages and incentives plus 
employee benefits) and card and processing expense. Total 

personnel costs increased $64 milli
on, or four percent, in 2011 
compared to 2010 due to an in
crease in base and incentive compensation driven by investments in the sales force beginning in  
 
mid-2010 and an overall increase in the number of employees. Full 

time equivalent employees totalled 21,334 at December 31, 2011 

compared to 20,838 at December 31, 2010. Card and processing expense increased $12 million, or 11%, in 
2011 compared to 2010 primarily as 
the result of growth in debit 

and credit card transactions. The major components of other 

noninterest expense are as follows:

                 Total other noninterest expense decreased $170 million, or 12%, in 
2011 compared to 2010 primarily due 
to decreases in the provision 
for representation and warranty claims, recorded in losses and 

adjustments; FDIC insurance and other taxes, intangible asset 

amortization, professional service fees and an increase in the benefit 

from a decrease in the reserve for unfunded commitments and 

letters of credit partially offset by  losses  in 2011 related to the 
termination of two cash flow hedges and an increase in litigation 

reserves associated with bankcard
 association membership, both of 
which were recorded in the ﬁotherﬂ caption.  
The provision for representation and warranty claims 
decreased $59 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a 

decrease in demand requests during 2011 and a decrease in losses on 

repurchased loans compared to 2010. FDIC insurance and other 
taxes decreased $41 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily 

to the FDIC™s implementation of amended regulations that revised 

the Federal Deposit Insurance Ac
t effective April 1, 2011. The 
amended regulations modified the definition of an institution™s 
deposit insurance assessment base from domestic deposits to 

quarterly average total assets less quarterly average tangible equity as 

well as the assessment rate calculation; additionally 2010 included 

expenses due to the Bancorp™s participation in the FDIC™s TLGP 

transaction account guarantee program, which was exited during the 
second quarter of 2010. The $21 million decrease in intangible asset 

amortization was primarily the result of the full amortization of 

certain intangible assets in 2010 and 2011. The decrease in 
professional service fees of $19 million in 2011 compared to 2010 

was primarily the result of legal ex
penses incurred from the litigation settlement related to one of the Bancorp™s BOLI policies during the 

third quarter of 2010. The provision for unfunded commitments and letters of credit was a benefit of $46 million in 2011 compared 

to a benefit of $24 million during 2010. The benefit recorded in 

each period reflects lower estimates of inherent losses resulting 

from a decrease in delinquent loans as credit trends improved 

during 2011. The $20 million increase in the ﬁotherﬂ caption was 

primarily the result of $27 milli
on in expenses on two cash flow 
hedge transactions that were terminated during the third quarter of 

2011 and $14 million of expenses related to an increase in litigation 

reserves associated with bankcard association membership during 

the fourth quarter of 2011 partially offset by an $8 million gain on 

the extinguishment of long term debt during 2011 compared to $17 

million of losses on the extinguishment of long term debt during 

2010.  TSA related expenses decreased to approximately $21 million 
in 2011 from $49 million in 2010 due to Vantiv Holding™s transition 
to their own supporting systems.   
The Bancorp continues to focus on efficiency initiatives as part of its core emphasis on operating leverage and expense control. The 

efficiency ratio (noninterest expe
nse divided by the sum of net 
interest income (FTE) and noninterest income) was 62.3% for 2011 

compared to 60.7% in 2010.    MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 Applicable Income Taxes 
The Bancorp™s income (loss) befo
re income taxes, applicable 
income tax expense (benefit) and effective tax rate for each of the 
periods indicated are shown in Table 12. Applicable income tax 
expense for all periods includes the benefit from tax-exempt 
income, tax-advantaged investments,
 certain gains on sales of leases that are exempt from federal taxation and tax credits, partially offset 

by the effect of nondeductible expenses. The tax credits are 

associated with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program 

established under Section 42 of the IRC, the New Markets Tax 

Credit program established under Section 45D of the IRC, the 
Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit program established under 
Section 47 of the IRC, and the Qualified Zone Academy Bond 
program established under Section 1397E of the IRC. The effective 

tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily 

impacted by $135 million in tax credits and $26 million of non-cash 

charges relating to previously recognized tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation that will not be realized.  The 

effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 

primarily impacted by $133 million in tax credits, a $26 million 
reduction in income tax expense resulting from the settlement of certain uncertain tax positions with the IRS and $25 million of non-

cash charges relating to previo
usly recognized tax benefits associated with stock-based compen
sation that will not be realized. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 

further information on income taxes.  

 
 Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
Certain sections of the IRC limit the deductibility of compensation 

paid to or earned by certain executive officers of a public company. 

This has historically limited the deductibility of certain executive 
compensation to $1 million per executive officer, and the Bancorp™s 
compensation philosophy has been to position pay to ensure 
deductibility. However, both the amount of the executive 

compensation that is deductible 
for certain executive officers and 
the allowable compensation vehicles
 changed as a result of the 
Bancorp™s participation in TARP. In particular, the Bancorp was not 

permitted to deduct compensation earned by certain executive 

officers in excess of $500,000 per executive officer as a result of the 
Bancorp™s participation in TARP. Therefore, a portion of the 
compensation earned by certain
 executive officers was not 
deductible by the Bancorp for the period in which the Bancorp 

participated in TARP. Subsequent 
to ending its participation in 
TARP, certain limitations on the deductibility of executive 

compensation will continue to apply to some forms of 

compensation earned while under TARP. The Bancorp™s 

Compensation Committee determined that the underlying executive 
compensation programs are appropriate and necessary to attract, 
retain and motivate senior execut
ives, and that failing to meet these 

objectives creates more risk for the Bancorp and its value than the 

financial impact of losing the tax deduction. For the years ended 

December 31, 2011 and 2010, the total tax impact for non-

deductible compensation was $2 million and $6 million, respectively.  
The Bancorp™s income before income taxes, applicable income 
tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows:

 BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 
The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Investment Advisors. Additional detailed financial information on each business 
segment is included in Note 30 of the Notes to Consolidated 

Financial Statements. Results of 
the Bancorp™s business segments are presented based on its management structure and management 

accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are 

specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the 
Bancorp™s business segments are not necessarily comparable with 
similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp 
refines its methodologies from time to time as management™s 

accounting practices are improved or businesses change.  
On June 30, 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of the 
processing business, which represented the sale of a majority 

interest in the Bancorp™s mer
chant acquiring and financial 
institutions processing businesses. Financial data for the merchant 
acquiring and financial institutions processing businesses was 
originally reported in the former Processing Solutions segment 
through June 30, 2009. As a result of the sale, the Bancorp no 

longer presents Processing Solutions as a segment and therefore, 

historical financial information 
for the merchant acquiring and 
financial institutions processing 
businesses has been reclassified 
under General Corporate and Other for all periods presented. 

Interchange revenue previously recorded in the Processing 

Solutions segment and associated with cards currently included in 
Branch Banking is now included in
 the Branch Banking segment for all periods presented. Additionally, the Bancorp retained its retail 
credit card and commercial multi-
card service businesses, which were also originally reported in the former Processing Solutions 

segment through June 30, 2009, and are included in the Branch 
Banking and Commercial Banking segments, respectively, for all 

periods presented. Revenue from the remaining ownership interest 

in the Processing Business is recorded in General Corporate and 
Other as noninterest income. 
The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level and employs a FTP methodology at the business segment level. This methodology insulates the business segments 

from interest rate volatility, 
enabling them to focus on serving 
customers through loan originations and deposit taking. The FTP 
system assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of assets and 

liabilities, respectively, based on 
expected duration and the LIBOR 
swap curve. Matching duration allocates interest income and interest expense to each segment so its resulting net interest income is 

insulated from interest rate risk. 
In a rising rate environment, the 
Bancorp benefits from the widening spread between deposit costs 
and wholesale funding costs. However, the Bancorp™s FTP system 
credits this benefit to deposit-providing businesses, such as Branch 

Banking and Investment Advisors, on a duration-adjusted basis. The 
net impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General 

Corporate and Other.   
The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as 
dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning 

assets and liabilities. The credit rate provided for DDAs is reviewed 
annually based upon the account type
, its estimated duration and the 
corresponding fed funds, LIBOR or swap rate. The credit rates for 
DDAs were reset January 1, 2011 to reflect the current market rates. 

These rates were significantly lower than those in place during 2010, 

thus net interest income for deposit providing businesses was 

negatively impacted during 2011.  
The business segments are charged provision expense based on the actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans owned by each 
segment. Provision expense attribut
able to loan growth and changes 
in factors in the ALLL are captured in General Corporate and 
Other. The financial results of the business segments include 

allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Even 
with these allocations, the financial results are not necessarily 

indicative of the business segments™ financial condition and results 

of operations as if they existed as independent entities. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-
sell opportunities and when funding operations, by accessing the 
capital markets as a collective un
it. Net income by business segment 
is summarized in the following table.

 Comparison of 2011 with 2010
 Net income was $441 million for the year ended December 31, 

2011, compared to net income of
 $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net income was primarily 
driven by a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses 

partially offset by lower net interest income and higher noninterest 

expense. 
Net interest income decreased $171 million primarily due to 
declines in the FTP credits for DDAs and decreases in interest 

income. The decrease in interest income was driven primarily by a 
decline in yields of 17 bps on average loans. Provision for loan and 
lease losses decreased $669 million. Net charge-offs as a percent of 

average loans and leases decrease
d to 128 bps for 2011 compared to 
302 bps for 2010 largely due net charge-offs on commercial loans 

moved to held for sale during the third quarter of 2010 and as a 

result of improved credit trends across all commercial loan types.  
Noninterest income was relatively flat from 2010 to 2011, as 
increases in other noninterest income and service charges on 
deposits were offset by a decrease in corporate banking revenue. 
The increase in other noninterest income is primarily due to a $15 

million increase in income on private equity investments. Service 

charges on deposits increased from 2010 primarily due to a decrease 

in earnings credits paid on customer balances. The decrease in 

corporate banking revenue was primarily driven by decreases in 

international income, institutional sales, and syndication fees 

partially offset by an increase in business lending fees.  
Noninterest expense increased $102 million from the prior year 
as a result of increases in salarie
s, incentives and benefits and other 
noninterest expense. The increase in 
salaries, incentives and benefits 
of $26 million was primarily the result of increased incentive 

compensation due to improved production levels. FDIC insurance 

expense, which is recorded in other noninterest expense, increased  

 $14 million due to a change in the methodology in determining 

FDIC insurance premiums to one based on total assets less tangible 
equity as opposed to the previous method that was based on 
domestic deposits. The remaining increase in other noninterest 

expense was the result of higher corporate overhead allocations in 

2011 compared to 2010.  Average commercial loans were flat compared to the prior year. 
Average commercial mortgage loans decreased $1.0 billion as a 

result of tighter underwriting standards implemented in prior 

quarters in an effort to limit exposure to commercial real estate. 
Average commercial construction loans decreased $1.2 billion due 

to runoff as management suspended new lending on non-owner 

occupied real estate in 2008. The decreases in average commercial 

mortgage and construction loans were offset by growth in average 

commercial and industrial loans, wh
ich increased $2.5 billion as a 
result of an increase in new loan origination activity. Average core deposits increased $1.2 billion compared to 2010. 
The increase was primarily driven by strong growth in DDAs, which 
increased $2.3 billion compared to the prior year. The increase in DDAs was partially offset by decreases in interest bearing deposits 
of $1.0 billion as customers opted to maintain their balances in 

more liquid accounts due to intere
st rates remaining near historical lows. 
 
Comparison of 2010 with 2009
 Commercial Banking realized net income of $178 million in 2010 
compared to a net loss of $101 million in 2009. This improvement 
was primarily due to an increase in net interest income and a 

decrease in provision for loan and lease losses. Net interest income 

increased $162 million primarily due to a mix shift from higher cost 

term deposits to lower cost deposit products. This improvement 

was partially offset by the negative impact to net interest income of 

a decrease in average commercial loans during 2010 and a decrease 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     41 
 of $35 million in the accretion of discounts on loans associated with 
a previous acquisition.   
Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $201 million from 2009. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases 
decreased from 329 bps in 2009 to 302 bps in 2010 due to actions 

taken by the Bancorp to address problem loans which resulted in 

significant net charge-offs recorded in 2009.  Noninterest income increased $26 million from 2009 primarily 
as a result of $24 million increase in gains on private equity 

investments, included in other noninterest income, and a $5 million 

increase in card and processing revenue partially offset by a $7 

million decrease in corporate banking revenue.  
Noninterest expense increased $11 million compared to 2009 
as the increase in salaries, incentives and benefits was partially offset 

by the decrease in other noninterest expense.  The decrease in other 
noninterest expense is due to a decrease in loan and lease expense as 

a result of lower loan demand during 2010, a decrease in collection 

related expenses and a decrease in FDIC expenses due to a special assessment in the second quarter of 2009. 
  Average commercial loans and leases decreased $3.0 billion 
compared to the prior year due to lower customer demand for new 
originations, lower utilization ra
tes on corporate lines and tighter 
underwriting standards. These impacts were partially offset by the 

consolidation of $724 million of commercial and industrial loans on 

January 1, 2010, which had a remaining balance of $372 million at 

December 31, 2010.   
Average core deposits increased $5.8 billion, or 32%, compared 
to 2009 due to the migration of high
er priced certificates of deposit 
into transaction accounts, as well 
as the impact of historically low 
interest rates and excess customer liquidity.

    Comparison of 2011 with 2010 

Net income increased $1 million compared to 2010, driven by a 

decline in the provision for loan and lease losses offset by a decrease 
in net interest income and noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $91 million 

compared to the prior year. The primary drivers of the decline 

include decreases in the FTP credits for DDAs, lower yields on 
average commercial and consumer lo
ans, and a decline in average 
commercial loans. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable shift in the segment™s deposit mix towards lower cost 
transaction deposits resulting in declines in interest expense of $193 

million compared to 2010, and an increase in average consumer 

loans. Provision for loan and lease losses for 2011 decreased $162 
million compared to the prior year. The decline in the provision was 
the result of improved credit trends across all consumer and 
commercial loan types. Net charge
-offs as a percent of average 
loans and leases decreased to 210 bps for 2011 compared to 313 bps 
for 2010. The decrease is the result of improved credit trends and 

tighter underwriting standards. In addition, the decrease is due to 

$24 million in charge-offs taken on $60 million of commercial loans 

which were sold or moved to held for sale during the third quarter 
of 2010.  Noninterest income decreased $48 million compared to the prior year.  The decrease was primarily driven by lower service 

charges on deposits, which declined $60 million, primarily due to 
the implementation of Regulation E in the third quarter of 2010. 
The decrease was partially offset by increased card and processing 

revenue caused by higher debit and credit card transaction volumes. 

Growth in processing revenue was partially offset by the impact of 

the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act™s debit card interchange 

fee cap in the fourth quarter of
 2011. Investment advisory revenue 
also increased due to improved market performance and sales force 

expansion. 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
42     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 Noninterest expense increased $23 million, primarily driven by 
increases in salaries, incentives and benefits expense and card and 
processing expense partially offset by a decline in other noninterest 

expense. Salaries, incentives and benefits expenses increased $23 
million due to an increase in 
base and incentive compensation 
driven by investments in the sales 
force, as well as additional branch 
personnel. Card and processing ex
pense increased $9 million due to increased costs associated with an increase in the redemption of 

points for debit and credit card rewards. Other noninterest expense 

declined $21 million primarily due 
to a decrease in FDIC insurance 
expense. 
Average consumer loans increased $1.0 billion in 2011 
primarily due to increases in average residential mortgage loans of 

$1.5 billion due to management™s decision in the third quarter of 2010 to retain certain mortgage lo
ans. The increases in average 
residential mortgage loans was partially offset by decreases in 
average home equity loans of $421 million due to decreased 

customer demand and continued ti
ghter underwriting standards. Average commercial loans decreased 
$194 million due to declines in 
commercial and industrial loans re
sulting from lower customer demand for new originations and continued tighter underwriting 

standards applied to both or
iginations and renewals. Average core deposits increased by $120 million compared to 
the prior year as the growth in transaction accounts due to excess 
customer liquidity and historically low interest rates outpaced runoff 

of higher priced certificates of deposit. 
 Comparison of 2010 with 2009 
Net income decreased $142 million compared to 2009 driven by an 
increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in net interest 

income partially offset by a decrease
 in provision for loan and lease 
losses. Net interest income decreased $63 million compared to 2009 

as the impact of lower loan balan
ces more than offset a favorable 

shift in the segment™s deposit mix towards lower cost transaction 

deposits.    
Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $46 million from 
2009. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases 
decreased from 326 bps in 2009 to 313 bps in 2010 primarily due to 

improved credit trends and tighter underwriting standards.  
Noninterest income decreased $17 million from 2009 primarily 
due to decreases in service charges on deposits, partially offset by 
increases in card and processing revenue and investment advisory 

revenue. Noninterest expense increased $183 million from 2009 due to 
additional personnel expenses, net occupancy and equipment 

expense, card and processing expense and other noninterest 

expense.     
 Average consumer loans decreased $153 million primarily due 
to a decrease in home equity loans due to decreased demand and 

tighter underwriting standards. Average commercial loans decreased 

$522 million due to lower customer
 demand for new originations, lower utilization rates on corporat
e lines and tighter underwriting 
standards.   
Average core deposits were relatively flat compared to 2009 as 
runoff of higher priced consumer cer
tificates of deposit, included in 
other time deposits, was replaced
 with growth in transaction 
accounts due to excess customer li
quidity and low interest rates. 
 Consumer Lending 
Consumer Lending includes the Bancorp™s mortgage, home equity, 

automobile and other indirect lending activities. Mortgage and home 

equity lending activities include the origination, retention and 

servicing of mortgage and home equity loans or lines of credit, sales 

and securitizations of those loans, 
pools of loans or lines of credit, 
and all associated hedging activities. Indirect lending activities 
include loans to consumers through mortgage brokers and 

automobile dealers. The following

    Comparison of 2011 with 2010
 Net income was $56 million in 2011 co
mpared to a net loss of $26 
million in 2010. The increase wa
s driven by a decline in the provision for loan and lease losses, partially offset by decreases in 

noninterest income and net interest income and an increase in 

noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $62 million due 

to a decline in average loan bala
nces for residential mortgage, home equity, and consumer leases as 
well as lower yields on average 
residential mortgage and automobile
 loans, partially offset by 
favorable decreases in the FTP ch
arge applied to the segment. Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $308 million 
compared to the prior year, as 
delinquency metrics and underlying loss trends improved across all consumer loan types. Additionally, 

2010 included charge-offs of $123 million on the sale of $228 

million of portfolio loans.  Net ch
arge-offs as a percent of average 
loans and leases decreased to 134 bps for 2011 compared to 305 bps 
for 2010.  
Noninterest income decreased $40 million primarily due to 
decreases in mortgage banking net revenue of $34 million driven by 
decreases in revenue associated with residential mortgage 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     43 
 origination activity.  The decrease from 2010 was driven by declines 
in origination fees and gains on loan sales of $78 million due to 

decreased margins and lower origination volumes, partially offset by 

an increase in net servicing revenue of $44 million. Net servicing 
revenue increased due to positive net valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge 
MSRs and an increase in servicing fees as a result of an increase in 
the size of the Bancorp™s servicing portfolio.  
Noninterest expense increased $80 million driven in part by 
increased FDIC insurance expense, as the methodology used to 

determine FDIC insurance premiums changed in 2011 from one 

based on domestic deposits to one based on total assets less tangible 
equity.  Additional changes were due 
to an increase of $41 million in 
the provision for representation and warranty claims related to 
residential mortgage loans sold to 
third parties and an increase of 

$21 million in losses on escrow ad
vances to borrowers relating to bank owned residential mortgages. The increase in the provision for 

representation and warranty claims was due to an increase in 

resolved claims in 2011 compared to 2010.  
Average consumer loans and leases increased $558 million 
from the prior year. Average au
tomobile loans increased $952 
million due to a strategic focus to increase automobile lending 

throughout 2010 and 2011 through 
consistent and competitive 
pricing, disciplined sales execution,
 and enhanced customer service 
with our dealership network. This increase was partially offset by 

declines across all other types of consumer loans. Average 

residential mortgage loans decreased $36 million as a result of the 

lower origination volumes discussed previously. Average home 
equity loans decreased $121 million due to continued runoff in the 
discontinued brokered home equity product. Average consumer 

leases decreased $226 million du
e to runoff as the Bancorp discontinued this product in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
 Comparison of 2010 with 2009
 Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $26 million in 2010 

compared to net income of $21 million in 2009 due to a decrease in 
net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense partially 
offset by an increase in noninterest income. Net interest income 

decreased $71 million from 2009 primarily due to a decrease in 

yields on average interest earning assets, which included the impact 

of a $23 million decrease in th
e accretion of discounts on loans associated with a previous acquisition partially offset by a decrease 

in funding costs during 2010.    
Provision for loan and lease losses increased $11 million from 
2009 as an increase in net charge-offs on residential mortgage loans 
was partially offset by decreased automobile loan and home equity 

net charge-offs. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases decreased from 307 bps in 2009 to 305 bps in 2010.  
Noninterest income increased $47 million, as the result of an 
increase in mortgage banking net revenue partially offset by a 

decrease in other noninterest income. The increase in mortgage 

banking net revenue was driven by increases in net valuation 

adjustments on MSRs and MSR derivatives and increases in 
servicing fees due to an increase in loans serviced for others. The 
decrease in other noninterest income was primarily due to decreases 

in securities gains related to mo
rtgage servicing rights hedging 
activities.   
Noninterest expense increased $37 million due to increases in 
salaries, incentives and benefits due 
to the continued high levels of mortgage loan originations in 2010 and an increase in other 

noninterest expense as a result of an increase in the representation 
and warranty reserve partially offset by a decrease in loan and lease 
expense. 
Average consumer loans were flat compared to 2009 as the increase in automobile loans was offset by decreases in all other 

consumer loan and lease products.

    Comparison of 2011 with 2010 

Net income decreased $5 million compared to 2010 primarily due to 

a decline in net interest income and an increase in noninterest 
expense partially offset by a decrease in the provision for loan and 
lease losses and an increase in investment advisory revenue. Net 
interest income decreased $25 million from 2010 due to a decline in 

average loan and lease balances as we

 leases decreased to 132 bps compared to 171 bps for the prior year 
reflecting moderation of general economic conditions during 2011.  
Noninterest income increased $17 million compared to 2010 
primarily due to increases in investment advisory revenue. The 
increase in investment advisory revenue was driven by an increase 
of $10 million in Private Bank income due to market performance 
and an increase of $7 million in securities and broker income due to 

continued expansion of the sales force and market performance. 
Noninterest expense increased $16 million compared to 2010 
due to increases in salaries, incentives and benefit expense resulting from the expansion of the sales force and compensation related to 

improved performance in investment advisory revenue related fees. 
Average loans and leases decreased $537 million compared to 
the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by declines in 
home equity loans of $373 million due to tighter underwriting 

standards. Average core deposits increased $901 million compared 

to 2010 due to growth in interest checking and foreign deposits as 
customers have opted to maintain 
excess funds in liquid transaction 
accounts as a result of interest rates remaining near historic lows. 

 Comparison of 2010 with 2009 
Net income decreased $24 million compared to 2009 as a decrease 

in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense were 

partially offset by a decrease in provision for loan and lease losses 

and an increase in investment advisory revenue. Net interest income 

decreased $19 million from 2009 due to a decrease in average loans 
and leases partially offset by an increase in the yield on interest 

earning assets.   
Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $13 million from 
2009. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases 
decreased from 183 bps in 2009 to 171 bps in 2010 reflecting 

moderation of general economic conditions during 2010. 
Noninterest income increased $20 million compared to 2009 
due to an increase in investment ad
visory revenue partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest income. Investment advisory 

revenue increased $31 million compared to 2009 due to increases in 
securities and broker income, private client service income and 
institutional income. 
 Noninterest expense increased $51 million compared to 2009 
due to higher personnel expenses as a result of the expansion of the 

sales force and compensation related to improved performance in 

investment advisory revenue related fees and due to an increase in 

expenses associated with the revenue sharing agreement between 

Investment Advisors and Branch Banking.     
Average loans and leases decreased $538 million from 2009 
primarily due to a decrease in commercial loans as a result of a 

decrease in demand and a decrease in line utilization rates among 
the Bancorp™s high net worth customers due to excess liquidity. 

Average core deposits increased $958 million compared to 2009 

primarily due to growth in interest checking and foreign deposits. 
 General Corporate and Other 

General Corporate and Other includ
es the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, certain non-core deposit funding, unassigned equity, provision 

expense in excess of net charge-offs or a benefit from the reduction 

of the ALLL, representation and 
warranty expense in excess of 
actual losses or a benefit from th
e reduction of representation and 
warranty reserves, the payment of preferred stock dividends and 

certain support activities and other items not attributed to the 

business segments. 
 Comparison of 2011 with 2010 

Results for 2011 and 2010 were impacted by a benefit of $748 

million and $789 million, respectively, due to reductions in the 

ALLL. The decrease in provision expense for both years was due to 

a decrease in nonperforming assets and improvement in 
delinquency metrics and underlying 
loss trends. Net interest income 
increased from $16 million in 2010 to $321 million for 2011 due to a 

benefit in the FTP rate. The change in net income compared to the 

prior year was impacted by a $127 
million benefit, net of expenses, from the settlement of litigation associated with one of the 

Bancorp™s BOLI policies that was recorded in the third quarter of 

2010. The results for 2011 were impacted by dividends on preferred 

stock of $203 million compared to $250 million in the prior year. 

2011 results included $153 million in preferred stock dividends as a 

result of the accelerated accr
etion of the remaining issuance discount on the Series F Preferred Stock that was repaid in the first 

quarter of 2011. 
 Comparison of 2010 with 2009 

The results for 2010 were impacted by $789 million in income due 

to a reduction in the ALLL during 2010 compared to $967 million 

of provision expense recorded in excess of net charge-offs during 

2009. The decrease in provision expense was due to a decrease in 

nonperforming assets and improvement in credit trends as general 

economic conditions began to show
 signs of moderation. The 2010 
results were also impacted by $152 million of noninterest income 

recognized from the settlement of litigation associated with one of 

the Bancorp™s BOLI policies and $25 million of noninterest expense 

from related legal fees associated with the settlement. The results for 

2009 were primarily impacted by a $1.8 billion gain resulting from 

the sale of the processing busine
ss. Results for 2009 also included a 
$244 million gain on the sale of the Bancorp™s Visa, Inc. Class B 

shares, a $73 million benefit from the reversal of the Visa litigation 
reserve, an $18 million benefit in noninterest income due to mark-
to-market adjustments on warrants 
and put options related to the 
sale of the processing business and a $106 million tax benefit as a 

result of the Bancorp™s decision to surrender one of its BOLI 

policies. These benefits were partially offset by a $54 million BOLI 

charge reflecting reserves recorded in the connection with the intent 

to surrender the policy. Additionally, the Bancorp recorded 

dividends on preferred stock of $226 million during 2009 compared 
to $250 million during 2010. 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     45 
 FOURTH QUARTER REVIEW The Bancorp™s 2011 fourth quarter net income available to common 
shareholders was $305 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared 
to net income available to common sh
areholders of $373 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2011 and net income 
available to common shareholders of $270 million, or $0.33 per 
diluted share, for the fourth qu
arter of 2010. Fourth quarter 2011 
earnings included a $54 million ch
arge to noninterest income related to changes in the fair value of 
a swap liability that the Bancorp 
entered into in conjunction with its sale of Visa, Inc Class B shares 

in 2009, a $30 million decrease in debit interchange revenue due to 
changes in debit interchange regulations and $10 million in positive 
valuation adjustments on puts and warrants associated with the sale 

of the processing business. Third 
quarter 2011 results included $28 
million of costs related to the termination of certain FHLB 

borrowings and hedging transactions and a $17 million reduction in 

other noninterest income related to the valuation of a total return 

swap entered into as part of the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. 
Fourth quarter 2010 earnings included the impact of a $17 million 
charge related to the early extinguishment of $1.0 billion in FHLB 

borrowings as well as $21 million in 
net investment securities gains. 
Provision expense was $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, 

down from $87 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $166 million 

in the fourth quarter of 2010. Both the sequential decrease and the decline from the fourth quarter of 2010 reflect improved credit 

trends, as evidenced by a decrease in net charge-offs and 

improvements in nonperforming assets and delinquent loans. The 
ALLL to loan and lease ratio wa
s 2.78% as of December 31, 2011, compared to 3.08% as of September 30, 2011 and 3.88% as of 
December 31, 2010.  
Fourth quarter 2011 net interest income of $920 million 
increased $18 million from the third quarter of 2011 and $1 million 

from the same period a year ago. The increase from the third 

quarter of 2011 was driven by both a decline in interest expense and 

an increase in interest income. In
terest expense declined $16 million 
from the third quarter of 2011, driven by lower deposit costs, 

including the $16 million impact of continued run-off of high-rate 

CDs and their replacement into lowe
r yielding products. Interest 
income increased $2 million from the third quarter of 2011 as an 
increase in average loans was partially offset by a decline in average 
securities and lower yields on average interest earning assets. Net 

interest income was flat in comparison to the fourth quarter of 

2010, largely due to lower loan and investment securities yields 
partially offset by higher average 
loan balances, run-off in higher-
priced CDs, and mix shift to lower cost deposit products.  
Fourth quarter 2011 noninterest income of $550 million 
decreased $115 million compared to the third quarter of 2011 and 
$106 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The sequential 

decline was driven by a $54 million reduction in income due to the 

increase in fair value of the liabilit
y related to the total return swap 
entered into as part of the 2009 sale
 of Visa, Inc. Class B shares, as well as a $22 million decrease in mortgage banking net revenue. 

Compared to the fourth quarter of
 2010, the decline was driven by decreases of $31 million in other noninterest income, $21 million in 

card and processing fees and $16 million in securities gains, net. The 
fourth quarter of 2011 included a benefit of $10 million in mark-to-

market adjustments on warrants and 
put options related to the sale 
of the processing business, compared to a benefit of $3 million in 
the third quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010.  Mortgage banking net revenue was $156 million in the fourth 
quarter of 2011, compared to $178 million in the third quarter of 

2011 and $149 million in the fourth 
quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter 
originations were $7.1 billion, compared to $4.5 billion in the 

previous quarter and $7.4 billion in
 the same quarter last year. These originations resulted in gains on mortgage loan sales of $152 million 

in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $119 million in the third 
quarter of 2011 and $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Gain 
on sale margins declined from third quarter of 2011 and fourth 
quarter of 2010 levels, due to increased competition for originations 
as volumes slowed during the qua
rter. Also impacting mortgage banking net revenue was net valu
ation adjustments on MSRs and 
MSR derivatives. In the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2010, losses on 
the Bancorp™s free-standing MSR derivatives exceeded impairment 

reversal recorded against the hedged MSRs. These factors led to a 

net loss of $54 million on the net valuation adjustments on MSRs in 

the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to a net zero and a net loss of 

$67 million in the third quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 
2010, respectively. A net loss on non-qualifying hedges on MSR of 
$3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 was included in noninterest 

income within the Consolidated Statements of Income, but shown 

separate from mortgage banking net revenue. Net gains on non-

qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights were $6 million and 

$14 million in the third quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 

2010, respectively. Service charges on deposits of $136 million increased one 
percent sequentially and decreased three percent compared to the 

fourth quarter of 2010. Retail service charges were flat sequentially 

and declined by seven percent from a year ago, largely driven by the 

impact of Regulation E. Commercial service charges increased two 

percent sequentially due to reductions in earnings credit rates and 
account growth and were flat when compared to the same quarter 
last year. Corporate banking revenue of $82 million decreased $5 million from the previous quarter and 
decreased $21 million from the 
fourth quarter of 2010. The sequential decline was primarily driven 

by lower foreign exchange, interest rate derivative, and lease 

remarketing fees. The year-over-year decline was driven by these 

factors as well as lower syndication fees and institutional sales 

revenue.  Investment advisory revenue of $90 million decreased two 
percent sequentially and three percen
t from the fourth quarter of 
2010. Sequential and year-over-year declines were driven by lower 

securities and brokerage revenue, institutional trust fees, and mutual 
fund fees partially offset by higher
 private client service revenue. 
Card and processing revenue of $60 million decreased $18 
million compared to the third quarter of 2011 and $20 million from 

the fourth quarter of 2010. Both decreases were driven by the 

impact of the recently enacted debit interchange legislation partially 

offset by increased transaction volumes and mitigation activity in 
response to the debit interchange legislation. 
The net gain on investment securities was $5 million in the 
fourth quarter of 2011 compared to a net gain of $26 million in the 
third quarter of 2011 and a net gain of $21 million in the fourth 

quarter of 2010.  Noninterest expense of $993 million increased $47 million 
sequentially and increased $6 million from the fourth quarter of 

2010. Fourth quarter 2011 expenses included $14 million of reserve 
related costs associated with bankcard association membership 

litigation and $5 million in other litigation reserve additions. Third 

quarter 2011 expenses included $28 million of costs related to the 

termination of certain FHLB borrowings and hedging transactions, 

while fourth quarter 2010 results included $17 million of expenses related to the early termination of $1.0 billion in FHLB borrowings. 

Excluding these items, noninterest expense increased six percent 

from the third quarter of 2011 and was flat compared with the 
fourth quarter of 2010, driven by
 increased mortgage fulfillment 
costs and $6 million of pension settlements. 
Net charge-offs totaled $239 million in the fourth quarter of 
2011, compared to $262 million in
 the third quarter of 2011 and 
$356 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decreases in net 
charge-offs from both periods reflects continued improvement in 

the credit quality of portfolio 
loans. Commercial net charge-offs 

were $113 million in the fourth qua
rter of 2011, compared to $136

 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $173 million in the fourth 
quarter of 2010. Consumer net charge-offs were $126 million in the 

fourth quarter and third quarter
 of 2011 and $183 million in the 
fourth quarter of 2010.   COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED 2010 WITH 2009 

Net income available to common shareholders for the year ended 

December 31, 2010 was $503 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, 

compared to net income available to common shareholders of $511 

million, or $0.67 per diluted share, in 2009. Overall, $152 million of 

noninterest income from the settlement of litigation associated with 

one of the Bancorp™s BOLI policie
s as well as an increase in mortgage banking net revenue and a decrease in the provision for 
loan and lease losses of $2.0 billion compared to 2009, were partially 

offset by decreases in noninterest income and card and processing 

revenue as well as $110 million of noninterest expense from charges 

to representation and warranty reserves related to residential 
mortgage loans sold to third parties. Results for 2009 also included a 

$106 million tax benefit as a result of the Bancorp™s decision to 

surrender one of its BOLI policies and a $55 million income tax 
benefit from an agreement with the IRS to settle all of the Bancorp™s disputed leverage leases
 for all open years. These benefits 
were partially offset by a $54 million BOLI charge reflecting 

reserves recorded in the connection with the intent to surrender the 

policy. While the Bancorp continued to be affected by rising 

unemployment rates, weakened housing
 markets, particularly in the 
upper Midwest and Florida, and a challenging credit environment, 
credit trends began to show signs of stabilization in late 2009, which 
led to the decrease in provision expense from $3.5 billion at 

December 31, 2009 to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010. 
Net interest income increased to $3.6 billion, from $3.4 billion 
in 2009. The primary reason for the seven percent increase in net 
interest income was a 39 bps increase 
in the net interest rate spread 
due to the runoff of higher priced term deposits in 2010 and the 

benefit of lower rates offered on new term deposits, as well as 

improved pricing on commercial loans. These benefits were partially 
offset by a decrease in the accretion of purchase accounting 
adjustments related to the 2008 acquisition of First Charter, which 

were $68 million in 2010, compared to $136 million in 2009. Net 

interest margin was 3.66% in 2010, 
an increase of 34 bps from 2009. 
Noninterest income decreased 43% to $2.7 billion in 2010 
compared to $4.8 billion in 2009, driven primarily by the sale of the 

processing business in the second quarter of 2009, which resulted in a gain of $1.8 billion, as well as a $244 million gain related to the sale 
of the Bancorp™s Visa, Inc. C
lass B shares in 2009. Mortgage banking net revenue increased $94 million as a result of strong net 
servicing revenue and higher margins on sold loans, partially offset 
by a decline in mortgage originat
ions. Card and processing revenue 
decreased 49% due to the sale of the processing business in the 
second quarter of 2009. Service charges on deposits decreased $58 

million primarily due to the impact of new overdraft regulation and 

policies which resulted in a decrease in overdraft occurrences. 
Investment advisory revenue increased $35 million as the result of 
improved market performance and sales production that drove an 

increase in brokerage activity 
and assets under care. Corporate 
banking revenue decreased two percent largely due to decreases in 

international income and lease remarketing fees, partially offset by 

growth in syndication and business lending fees. 
Noninterest expense increased $29 million, or one percent, 
compared to 2009. Noninterest expense in 2010 included $25 
million in legal fees associated with the settlement of claims with the 
insurance carrier on one of the Bancorp™s BOLI policies while 

noninterest expense in 2009 included
 a $73 million reduction in the 
Visa litigation reserve as well as a $55 million FDIC special 

assessment charge. Total personnel costs increased $94 million, or six percent in 2010 compared to 2009,
 due primarily to investments 
in the sales force in 2010. In addition, charges to representation and 
warranty reserves related to residential mortgage loans sold to third-
parties totaled $110 million in 2010, compared to $31 million in 

2009 due to a higher volume of 
repurchase demands. Partially 
offsetting these negative impacts was a $123 million decrease in the 
provision for unfunded commitments and letters of credit due to 
lower estimates of inherent losses as the result of a decrease in 

delinquent loans driven by moderation in economic conditions 

during 2010. In addition, card and processing expense decreased 
$85 million compared to 2009 due to the sale of the processing 

business in the second quarter of 2009. Noninterest expense in 2010 

and 2009 included $242 million and $269 million, respectively, of 

FDIC insurance and other taxes.  
Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases 
decreased to 3.02% in 2010 comp
ared to 3.20% in 2009. In the 

third quarter of 2010, the Bancorp took significant actions to reduce 

credit risk. Residential mortgage loans in the Bancorp™s portfolio 

with a carrying value of $228 million were sold for $105 million, 

generating $123 million in net charge-offs. Additionally, commercial 

loans with a carrying value prior to transfer of $961 million were 

transferred to held-for-sale, generating $387 million in net charge-
offs. Including the impact of these actions, nonperforming assets as 
a percent of loans, leases and other assets, including other real estate 
owned (excluding nonaccrual loans held for sale) decreased to 

2.79% at December 31, 2010, from 4.22% at December 31, 2009. The Bancorp took a number of ac
tions to strengthen its capital 
position in 2009. On June 4, 2009, the Bancorp completed an at-

the-market offering resulting in the sale of $1 billion of its common 

shares at an average share price of $6.33. In addition, on June 17, 
2009, the Bancorp completed its offer to exchange shares of its 
common stock and cash for shares of its Series G convertible 

preferred stock. As a result, the Bancorp recognized an increase in 

net income available to common shareholders of $35 million based 

upon the difference in carrying value of the Series G preferred 

shares and the fair value of the common shares and cash issued.

               Total loans and leases, including loans held for sale, increased $4.3 
billion, or five percent, from December 31, 2010. The increase in total loans and leases from December 31, 2010 was the result of a 
$1.9 billion, or four percent, increase in commercial loans and a $2.4 
billion, or seven percent, incr
ease in consumer loans.  
The increase of $1.9 billion in commercial loans and leases 
from 2010 was primarily due to 
an increase in commercial and 
industrial loans partially offset 
by a decrease in commercial 

mortgage and commercial constr
uction loans. Commercial and industrial loans increased $3.6 billi
on, or 13%, due to an increase in 

new loan origination activity. Commercial mortgage loans decreased 

$778 million, or seven percent, and commercial construction loans 

decreased $1.1 billion, or 51%, from December 31, 2010 as the 

Bancorp experienced continued run-
off in these loan categories. 
The run-off activity was the result of management™s decision to 
suspend new homebuilder and developer lending in 2007 and non-

owner occupied real estate lending in 2008 combined with weak 

customer demand for owner-occupied commercial mortgage loans 

and tighter underwriting standards.  
Total consumer loans and leases increased $2.4 billion from 
2010 primarily due to an increase in
 residential mortgage loans and 
automobile loans partially offset by a decrease in home equity loans 
and other consumer loans and leases. The increase of $2.6 billion, or 

24%, in residential mortgage loans from December 31, 2010, was 

driven by a $1.7 billion increase in portfolio loans due to management™s decision in the third quarter of 2010 and throughout 
2011 to retain certain shorter term residential mortgage loans 

originated through the Bancorp™s retail branches. Additionally, 

residential mortgage loans held for sale increased $901 million from 
December 31, 2010 due to an increase in refinancing activity in the 
fourth quarter of 2011 and the timing of delivery of loans. 

Automobile loans increased $844 million, or eight percent, 

compared to December 31, 2010, due 
to strong origination volumes 
through consistent and competitive pricing, enhanced customer 

service with our dealership network and disciplined sales execution. 

Home equity loans decreased $794 million, or seven percent, due to 

tighter underwriting standards implemented in 2010 and 2011 and 
decreased customer demand. Other consumer loans and leases, primarily made up of automobile 
leases as well as student loans 

designated as held for sale, decreased $338 million, or 48%, 

compared to December 31, 2010 due to a decline in new 

originations driven by tighter underwriting standards implemented 
in 2010 and 2011 and runoff due to the Bancorp™s decision to 

discontinue auto lease originations.

48     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 Average total commercial loans and leases decreased $254 million, 
or one percent, compared to December 31, 2010. The decrease in 
average total commercial loans and leases was driven by a decrease 
in average commercial mortgage loans and average commercial 
construction loans, partially offset by an increase in average 
commercial and industrial loans. Average commercial mortgage 

loans decreased $1.1 billion, or 10%, average commercial 
construction loans decreased $1.3 billion, or 43%, and average 

commercial and industrial loans increased $2.2 billion, or eight 

percent due to the reasons previously discussed.  
Average total consumer loans and 
leases increased $1.2 billion, or four percent, compared to 
December 31, 2010. The increase in 
average total consumer loans an
d leases from December 2010 was 
driven by an increase in average residential mortgage loans and 

average automobile loans, partially
 offset by a decrease in home equity loans and other consumer loans and leases. Average 
residential mortgage loans increased $1.5 billion, or 15%, average 
automobile loan balances increased $925 million, or nine percent, 
average home equity loans decreased 
$919 million, or eight percent, 
and average other consumer lo
ans and leases decreased $214 million, or 29%, from December 31, 2010 due to the reasons 

previously discussed.   Investment Securities 
The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing 

interest rate risk, providing liquidity support and providing collateral 
for pledging purposes. As of December 31, 2011, total investment 

securities were $15.9 billion compared to $16.1 billion at December 

31, 2010. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements for the Bancorp™s methodology for both classifying 

investment securities and management™s evaluation of securities in 
an unrealized loss position for OTTI. 
   
 
 
  At December 31, 2011, the Bancorp™s investment portfolio 
consisted primarily of AAA-rated 
available-for-sale securities. 
During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bancorp 

recognized $19 million and $3 million of OTTI on its investments 

securities portfolio, respectively. During the year ended December 

31, 2009, OTTI was immaterial to the Consolidated Financial 

Statements.  The Bancorp did not hold asset-backed securities backed by 
subprime mortgage loans in its investment portfolio. Additionally, 

there was approximately $122 million 
of securities classified as 
below investment grade as of December 31, 2011, compared to 
$137 million as of December 31, 2010.

(b) Other securities consist of FHLB and FRB restricted stock ho
ldings that are carried at par, FHLMC and FNMA preferred stock 
holdings and certain mutual fund holdings and equity security 
holdings. 
 As of December 31, 2011, available-for-sale securities on an 
amortized cost basis decreased $
305 million, or two percent, from 
December 31, 2010 due to a decrease in agency mortgage-backed 
securities, partially offset by an increase in U.S. government sponsored agencies securities and 
an increase in other bonds, notes and debentures. Agency mortgage-bac
ked securities decreased from 
2010 as excess cash was invested in other short-term investments. 
The increase in both U.S. government sponsored agencies securities 

and other bonds, notes and debentures was primarily driven by 

increased purchases of these instruments. 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, available-for-sale securities 
were 14% of total interest-earning assets compared to 15% at 

December 31, 2010. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt 
securities in the available-for-sale portfolio was 3.6 years at 
December 31, 2011, compared to 4.4 years at December 31, 2010.  
 In addition, at December 31,
 2011, the available-for-sale 
securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.66%, 

compared to 4.24% at December 31, 2010. 
Information presented in Table 21 is on a weighted-average life 
basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is 
presented on an FTE basis and is computed using historical cost 

balances. Maturity and yield calculat
ions for the total available-for-
sale portfolio exclude equity securities that have no stated yield or 

maturity. Total net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale 

securities portfolio were $748 million at December 31, 2011, 

compared to $495 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in 

net unrealized gains was due to th
e Federal Reserve™s low interest rates causing an increase in investor demand for higher-coupon 
securities that offer a higher yield.

 Trading securities decreased $117 million, or 40%, compared to 
December 31, 2010. The decrease from December 31, 2010 was 

driven primarily by the sale of 
VRDNs during the first quarter of 2011, which were held by the Bancorp in its trading securities 

portfolio. These securities were purchased from the market through 

FTS who was also the remarketing ag
ent. Rates on these securities  
  
declined in 2010 and into 2011 
and, as a result, the Bancorp 

continued to sell the VRDNs, replacing them with higher-yielding 

agency mortgage-backed securities classified as available-for-sale. 
For more information on VRDNs, see Note 17 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  Deposits 
The Bancorp™s deposit balances represent an important source of 
funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to 

focus on core deposit growth in it
s retail and commercial franchises  
  
 
by improving customer satisfacti
on, building full relationships and 
offering competitive rates. Core deposits represented 71% and 70% 

of the Bancorp™s asset funding base at December 31, 2011 and 

2010, respectively.  TABLE 22: DEPOSITS

December 31, 2010, driven by an increase of $8.4 billion, or 12%, in 

transaction deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $3.1 billion, or 40%, in other time deposits. Transaction deposits increased due to 

an increase in demand deposits, interest checking deposits, and 
savings deposits, partially offset by a decrease in foreign office 

deposits. Demand deposits increased $6.2 billion, or 29%, due to an 

increase in new accounts, growth
 from maturing certificates of 

deposits, and commercial customers opting to hold money in 

demand deposit accounts rather 
than investing excess cash given

 current market conditions. Interest checking deposits increased $1.8 
billion, or 10%, primarily due to an
 increase in new accounts from 
the Preferred Checking Program introduced in February 2011 and 

growth from maturing certificate
s of deposits. Savings deposits 
increased $853 million, or four percent, primarily due to growth 

from maturing certificates of deposits and the impact of the 

relationship savings program. Othe
r time deposits decreased $3.1 
billion, or 40%, compared to December 31, 2010, primarily as a 
result of continued runoff of certificates of deposits due to the low 

interest rate environment, as customers have opted to maintain 

balances in more liquid transaction accounts.  
Included in core deposits are foreign office deposits, which are 
primarily Eurodollar sweep accounts from the Bancorp™s commercial customers. These accounts 
bear interest rates at slightly higher than money market accounts and unlike repurchase 

agreements the Bancorp does not ha
ve to pledge collateral. Foreign office deposits decreased $471 million, or 13%, from December 31, 
2010 due to a reduction in sweep activity from commercial demand 
deposits. 
The Bancorp uses certificates of deposit $100,000 and over, as 
a method to fund earning asset growth. At December 31, 2011, 
certificates $100,000 and over decreased $1.2 billion, or 29%, 

compared to December 31, 2010 due to continued runoff from the 
low rate environment. The following table presents average deposits for the twelve

       On an average basis, core deposits
 increased $2.5 billion, or three percent, compared to December 31, 2010 due to increases in 

demand deposits of $3.7 billion, interest checking of $489 million 
and savings deposits of $2.0 billion, partially offset by a decrease in 
other time deposits of $4.3 billion.  This activity was the result of 
the migration of other time deposits and certificates of deposits 

greater than $100,000 into transact
ion accounts, due to the impact 
of historically low rates and excess customer liquidity and the 
reasons discussed above.   
Borrowings
 Total borrowings increased $1.9 billion, or 16%, from December 
31, 2010 due primarily to an increase in other short-term 
borrowings. As of December 31, 2011, total borrowings as a 

percentage of interest-bearing liabilities was 19% compared to 16% 

at December 31, 2010.  TABLE 24: BORROWINGS

term FHLB borrowings due to the runoff of certificates of deposits 

greater than $100,000. Long-term 
debt increased $124 million, or one percent, from December 31, 2010 due to the issuance of $1.0 

billion in senior notes during the first quarter of 2011 and a $375 

million increase in structured repurchase agreements. The increase 
in long-term debt was partially o
ffset by the redemption of $519 million of certain trust preferred securities during 2011, the 

redemption of a $500 million long-term FHLB advance during the 

third quarter of 2011, and pay-
downs related to previously consummated home equity and auto loan securitizations. In 

addition the Bancorp purchased 
$85 million of outstanding home 
equity securitization debt from the market in 2011 which was 

accounted for as an extinguishment of debt. For further information 

on the Bancorp™s previous securitization activity refer to Note 11 of 
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2011, 

the Bancorp recorded an $8 million gain on extinguishment of long-

term debt within other noninterest expense in the Consolidated 

Statements of Income.

monitoring and reporting risks. The ERM division, led by the 

Bancorp's Chief Risk Officer, and the Bancorp Credit division, led 

by the Bancorp™s Chief Credit Officer, ensure the consistency and 

adequacy of the Bancorp's risk management approach within the 

structure of the Bancorp's affiliate operating model. In addition, 

the Internal Audit division provides an independent assessment of 

the Bancorp's internal control structure and related systems and 

processes. 
The assumption of risk require
s robust and active risk 
management practices that co
mprise an integrated and 
comprehensive set of activities, mea
sures and strategies that apply 
to the entire organization. The Bancorp has established a Risk 

Appetite Framework that provides the foundations of corporate 

risk capacity, risk appetite and ri
sk tolerances. The Bancorp's risk capacity is represented by its available financial resources. Risk 

capacity sets an absolute limit on
 risk-assumption in the Bancorp's 
annual and strategic plans. The Ba
ncorp understands that not all financial resources may persist as viable loss buffers over time. 

Further, consideration must be 
given to planned or foreseeable 
events that would reduce risk capacity. Those factors take the 
form of capacity adjustments to arrive at an Operating Risk 

Capacity. Operating Risk Capacity
 represents the operating risk 
level the Bancorp can assume while maintaining its solvency 

standard. The Bancorp's policy currently discounts its Operating 
Risk Capacity by a minimum of five
 percent to provide a buffer; as 
a result, the Bancorp's risk appetite is limited by policy to, at most, 

95% of its Operating Risk Capacity. 
Economic capital is the amount of unencumbered financial 
resources required to support the Bancorp's risks. The Bancorp 

measures economic capital under the 
assumption that it expects to 
maintain debt ratings at strong investment grade levels over time. 

The Bancorp's capital policies require that the Operating Risk 
Capacity less the aforementioned buffer exceed the calculated 
economic capital required in its business. 
Risk appetite is the aggregate amount of risk the Bancorp is 
willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic and financial objectives. 

By establishing boundaries around risk taking and business 

decisions, and by incorporating the needs and goals of its 

shareholders, regulators, rating agencies and customers, the 

Bancorp's risk appetite is aligned with its priorities and goals. Risk 
tolerance is the maximum amount of risk applicable to each of the 
eight specific risk categories included in its Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework. This is expressed primarily in qualitative 
terms. The Bancorp's risk appetite and risk tolerances are 

supported by risk targets and risk limits. Those limits are used to 

monitor the amount of risk a
ssumed at a granular level. 
The risks faced by the Bancorp include, but are not limited 
to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance, 
legal, reputational and strategic. Each of these risks is managed 
through the Bancorp's risk progra
m which includes the following 
key functions: 

   Ł   Enterprise Risk Management Programs is responsible for 
developing and overseeing the implementation of risk 
programs and reporting that facilitate a broad integrated 
view of risk. The department also leads the continual 
fostering of a strong risk management culture and the 

framework, policies and committees that support effective 

risk governance, including the oversight of Sarbanes-Oxley 

compliance;   Ł   Commercial Credit Risk Management provides safety and 
soundness within an independent portfolio management 
framework that supports the Bancorp's commercial loan 

growth strategies and underwriting practices, ensuring 
portfolio optimization and appropriate risk controls; 
 Ł Risk Strategies and Reporting is responsible for 
quantitative analysis needed to support the commercial 

dual rating methodology, ALLL methodology and analytics 

needed to assess credit risk and develop mitigation 

strategies related to that risk. The department also provides 

oversight, reporting and monitoring of commercial 

underwriting and credit admini
stration processes. The Risk 
Strategies and Reporting department is also responsible for 
the economic capital program; 
 Ł Consumer Credit Risk Management provides safety and 
soundness within an independent management framework 
that supports the Bancorp's consumer loan growth 

strategies, ensuring portfolio optimization, appropriate risk controls and oversight, reporting, and monitoring of 

underwriting and credit administration processes; 
 Ł Operational Risk Management works with affiliates and 
lines of business to maintain processes to monitor and 

manage all aspects of operati
onal risk, including ensuring 
consistency in application of operational risk programs; 
 Ł Bank Protection oversees and manages fraud prevention 
and detection and provides investigative and recovery 

services for the Bancorp; 
 Ł Capital Markets Risk Management is responsible for 
instituting, monitoring, and reporting appropriate trading 
limits, monitoring liquidity, interest rate risk and risk 
tolerances within Treasury, Mortgage, and Capital Markets 

groups and utilizing a value at risk model for Bancorp 

market risk exposure;  Ł Regulatory Compliance Risk Management ensures that 
processes are in place to monitor and comply with federal 

and state banking regulations, including fiduciary 

compliance processes. The function also has the 
responsibility for maintenance of an enterprise-wide 
compliance framework; and  Ł The ERM division creates and maintains other functions, 
committees or processes as are necessary to effectively 

manage risk throughout the Bancorp. 
 
Risk management oversight and governance is provided by 
the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors 
and through multiple management committees whose 
membership includes a broad cro
ss-section of line-of-business, 
affiliate and support representatives. The Risk and Compliance 

Committee of the Board of Directors consists of five outside 

directors and has the responsibility for the oversight of risk 

management for the Bancorp, as well as for the Bancorp's overall 

aggregate risk profile. The Risk and Compliance Committee of the 

Board of Directors has approved the formation of key 
management governance committees that are responsible for 
evaluating risks and controls. The primary committee responsible 

for the oversight of risk management is the ERMC. Committees 

accountable to the ERMC, which support the core risk programs, 

are the Corporate Credit Commi
ttee, the Operational Risk 
Committee, the Management Compliance Committee, the 

Asset/Liability Committee and the Enterprise Marketing 

Committee. Other committees accountable to the ERMC oversee 
the ALLL, capital and community reinvestment act/fair lending 
functions. There are also new products and initiatives processes 

applicable to every line of business to ensure an appropriate 

standard readiness assessment is performed before launching a 

new product or initiative. Signific
ant risk policies approved by the 

management governance committees are also reviewed and

Directors. Finally, Credit Risk Review is an independent function 
responsible for evaluating the sufficiency of underwriting, 
documentation and approval processes for consumer and 
commercial credits, the accuracy of risk grades assigned to 
commercial credit exposure, appropriate accounting for charge-
offs, and nonaccrual status and specific reserves. Credit Risk 

Review reports directly to the Risk and Compliance Committee of 

the Board of Directors and administratively to the Director of 
Internal Audit. 
CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 
The objective of the Bancorp™s credit
 risk management strategy is to 
quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as 
well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from an individual customer 

default. The Bancorp's credit risk management strategy is based on 

three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. 
The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins 

with conservative lending practices. These practices include 

conservative exposure and counterparty limits and conservative 
underwriting, documentation an
d collection standards. The Bancorp's credit risk management strategy also emphasizes 

diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well 

as regular credit examinations and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credit
s experiencing deterioration of 

credit quality. Credit officers with the authority to extend credit are 
delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is 

closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and ERM manages the policy and the authority delegation process 
directly. The Credit Risk Revi
ew function provides objective 
assessments of the quality of unde
rwriting and documentation, the 

accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve 

analysis process. The Bancorp™s credit review process and overall 

assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is 

based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses 

inherent in the loan and lease 
portfolio. The Bancorp uses these 
assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases 
within the portfolio, maintain an
 adequate reserve and take any 

necessary charge-offs.  Fifth Third defines potential problem loans 

as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a 

nonperforming asset or a restructured loan.  See Note 6 of the 

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further 

information on the Bancorp™s credit grade categories, which are 

derived from standard regulatory rating definitions.  The following

      In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that 

exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial 

credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. 

The risk grading system currently utilized for reserve analysis 

purposes encompasses ten categories. The Bancorp also maintains a 

dual risk rating system that provides for thirteen probabilities of 

default grade categories and an additional six grade categories for 
estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of 
default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the 
ten-grade risk rating system. The Bancorp has completed significant 
validation and testing of the dual risk rating system and will make a 

decision on the implementation of th
e dual risk rating model for 
purposes of determining the Bancorp™s ALLL once the FASB has 

issued a final standard regarding previously proposed methodology 

changes to the determination of credit impairment as outlined in the 

ﬁAccounting for Financial Instruments and Revisions to the Accounting for Derivative Inst
ruments and Hedging Activities
ﬂ Exposure Draft and Supplementary Document dated May 2010 and 
January 2011, respectively. Scoring systems, various analytical tools 
and delinquency monitoring are used to
 assess the credit risk in the 
Bancorp's homogenous consumer and small business loan 

portfolios. 

 
Overview 

General economic conditions started to improve during 2010 and 

were mixed in 2011. Geographically, the Bancorp continues to 

experience the most stress in Michigan and Florida due to the 
decline in real estate values. Real estate value deterioration, as 
measured by the Home Price Index, was most prevalent in Florida due to past real estate price appreciation and related over-

development, and in Michigan due in part to cutbacks in automobile manufacturing and the state™s economic downturn. Among 

commercial portfolios, the homebuilder, residential developer and 

portions of the remaining non-owner occupied commercial real 

estate portfolios continue to remain under stress. Among consumer portfolios, residential mortgage and 
brokered home equity portfolios exhibited the most stress. 

Management suspended homebuilder and developer lending in the 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
54     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 fourth quarter of 2007 and new commercial non-owner occupied 
real estate lending in the second quarter of 2008, discontinued the 

origination of brokered home equity
 products at the end of 2007 
and tightened underwriting standards across both the commercial 
and consumer loan product offerings. Since the fourth quarter of 
2008, in an effort to reduce loan
 exposure to the real estate and 
construction industries, the Bancorp has sold certain consumer 

loans and sold or transferred to held for sale certain commercial 

loans. Throughout 2010 and 2011,
 the Bancorp continued to 
aggressively engage in other loss mitigation strategies such as 

reducing credit commitments, restructuring certain commercial and 

consumer loans, tightening unde
rwriting standards on commercial 
loans and across the consumer loan portfolio, as well as utilizing 
expanded commercial and consumer loan workout teams. In the 

financial services industry, there has been heightened focus on 
foreclosure activity and processes. Fifth Third actively works with 
borrowers experiencing difficulties and has regularly modified or 
provided forbearance to borrowers
 where a workable solution could 
be found. Foreclosure is a last resort, and the Bancorp undertakes 
foreclosures only when it believes they are necessary and 
appropriate and are careful to ensure that customer and loan data 
are accurate. Reviews of the Bancorp™s foreclosure process and 
procedures conducted last year did not reveal any material 

deficiencies. These reviews were expanded and extended in 2011 to 
improve our processes as additional aspects of the industry's 

foreclosure practices have come under intensified scrutiny and 

criticism. These reviews are completed and the Bancorp may 

determine to amend its processes and procedures as a result of these 
reviews. While any impact to the Bancorp that ultimately results 
from continued reviews cannot yet be determined, management 

currently believes that such impact will not materially adversely 

affect the Bancorp's results of 
operations, liquidity or capital 
resources. Additionally, banking regulatory agencies and other 

federal and state governmental authorities have continued to review 

the foreclosure process of mortgage servicers such as Fifth Third 

beyond the initial examinations of the largest mortgage servicers 
they conducted last year and earlier this year. These ongoing reviews 
could subject Fifth Third and other 
mortgage servicers to sanctions, 
civil money penalties and/or requi
rements to undertake remedial 
measures. 
 
Commercial Portfolio  

The Bancorp™s credit risk managemen
t strategy includes minimizing 
concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has 
commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of  
business within the commercial segment, geography and credit 
product type. 
The risk within the commercial 
loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing 
detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, 
monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and 

continuous portfolio risk management reporting. The origination 

policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting 

requirements for owner and non-owner occupied and construction 

lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization 

terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, 
construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, 
pre-leasing requirements (as applicable) and sensitivity and pro-
forma analysis requirements. The Bancorp requires a valuation of 
real estate collateral, which may 
include third-party appraisals, be 
performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with 

regulatory requirements and on an as needed basis when market 

conditions justify. Although the 
Bancorp does not back test these 
collateral value assumptions, the Bancorp maintains an appraisal 

review department to order and review third-party appraisals in 
accordance with regulatory requirements. Collateral values on 
criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed 

quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the 

assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves. In addition, the 

Bancorp applies incremental valuation haircuts to older appraisals 

that relate to collateral dependent lo
ans, which can currently be up 
to 25-40% of the appraised value based on the type of collateral. 

These incremental valuation haircuts generally reflect the age of the 
most recent appraisal as well as co
llateral type. Trends in collateral values, such as home price indices and recent asset dispositions, are 
monitored in order to determine whether adjustments to the 

appraisal haircuts are warranted. Other factors such as local market 

conditions or location may also be considered as necessary. 
The Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate 
collateral securing a loan and cons
iders all cross collateralized loans 
in the calculation of the LTV rati
o. The following table provides detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans 

greater than $1 million, excluding impaired commercial mortgage 

loans individually evaluated. The Bancorp does not typically 

aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than 

$1 million.

 MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     57 
 Consumer Portfolio
 The Bancorp™s consumer portfolio 
is materially comprised of three 
categories of loans: residential mortgage, home equity, and 
automobile. The Bancorp has identi
fied certain categories within these loan types which it believes represent a higher level of risk 

compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio due to high 

loan amount to collateral value.  
The Bancorp does not update LTV 
ratios for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except 

as part of the charge-off process 
for real estate secured loans.    
Residential Mortgage Portfolio 
The Bancorp manages credit risk in the mortgage portfolio through 
conservative underwriting and documentation standards and 
geographic and product diversification. The Bancorp may also 

package and sell loans in the portfolio or may purchase mortgage 

insurance for the loans sold in order to mitigate credit risk.  
The Bancorp does not originate mortgage loans that permit 
customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are 
less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed 
and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans. Resets of rates on 

adjustable rate mortgages are not expected to have a material impact 

on credit costs in the current interest rate environment, as 

approximately $1.2 billion of adju
stable rate residential mortgage 
loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months, with 

approximately three percent of thos
e resets expected to experience 

an increase in monthly payments in comparison to the monthly 

payment at the time of origination.  
Certain residential mortgage products have contractual features 
that may increase credit exposure to the Bancorp in the event of a 

decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered 
by the Bancorp include loans with 
high LTV ratios, multiple loans 
on the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater 

than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp monitors residential 

mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTV ratio and no mortgage 

insurance as it believes these loans represent a higher level of risk. 

The following table provides an analysis of the residential mortgage 

portfolio loans outstanding, excluding held for sale, by LTV at 
origination:   TABLE 34: RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PORT

  MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
58     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 Home Equity Portfolio The Bancorp™s home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of 

home equity lines of credit. The home equity line of credit offered 
by the Bancorp is a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum 
payments of interest only and a balloon payment of principal at 
maturity.  The ALLL provides coverage for probable and estimable losses 
in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the 

portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured 

in a TDR is determined on a single homogenous pool basis 

reflecting the Bancorp™s belief that the credit risk characteristics of 

this portfolio are of sufficient similarity such that additional 
portfolio segmentation is not necessary for determining the 
probable credit losses in the home equity portfolio. The modeled 

loss factor for the home equity 
portfolio is based on the trailing 
twelve month historical loss rate, as 
adjusted for certain prescriptive 
loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect 

risks associated with current conditions and trends. The prescriptive 

loss rate factors include adjust
ments for delinquency trends, LTV 
trends, refreshed FICO score 
trends and product mix. The 
qualitative factors include adjustmen
ts for credit administration and 
portfolio management, credit po
licy and underwriting and the 
national and local economy. The Bancorp considers home price 

index trends when determining the national and local economy 

qualitative factor. 
The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary 
categories: loans outstanding with a LTV greater than 80% and 

those loans with a LTV 80% or less based upon appraisals at 
origination. The carrying value of the greater than 80% LTV home 
equity loans and 80% or less LTV home equity loans were $4.0 
billion and $6.7 billion, respectiv
ely, as of December 31, 2011. Of 
the total $10.7 billion of outstanding home equity loans:  
 82% reside within the Bancorp™s Midwest footprint of 
Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois  31% are in first lien positions and 69% are in second lien 
positions at December 31, 2011  
 For approximately 1/3 of the home equity portfolio in a 

second lien position, the first lien is either owned or 
serviced by the Bancorp 
 Over 90% of non-delinquent borrowers made at least one 
payment greater than the minimum payment during the 
year ended December 31, 2011 
 The portfolio had an average refreshed
 FICO score of 734 
at December 31, 2011 and 2010.   
 The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes 
reductions in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on 

FICO score deterioration and property devaluation.  The Bancorp 

does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update 

LTV ratios after origination.  However, the Bancorp monitors the 

local housing markets by reviewin
g various home price indices and 
incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its on-

going credit monitoring processes.  For second lien home equity 
loans, the Bancorp is unable to track the performance of the first 
lien loans if it does not service the first lien loan, but instead 
monitors the refreshed FICO scores as part of its assessment of the 

home equity portfolio. The following table provides an analysis of 

home equity loans outstanding di
saggregated based upon refreshed 
FICO score:

  Automobile Portfolio The automobile portfolio is charac
terized by direct and indirect 
lending products to consumers. As of December 31, 2011, 49% of 

the automobile loan portfolio is co
mprised of new automobiles. It is 
a common practice to advance on automobile loans an amount in excess of the automobile value due to the inclusion of taxes, title, 

and other fees paid at closing. The Bancorp monitors its exposure 

to these higher risk loans. The fo

  European Exposure  
The Bancorp has no direct sovereign exposure to any European 

nation as of December 31, 2011.  In providing services to our 

customers, the Bancorp routinely en
ters into financial transactions 
with foreign domiciled and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign businesses as well as foreign financial institutions
.  These financial transactions are 
in the form of loans, loan commit
ments, letters of credit, derivatives 

and securities.  The Bancorp™s risk appetite for foreign country 

exposure is managed by having es
tablished country exposure limits. The Bancorp™s total exposure to European domiciled or owned 

businesses and European financial institutions was $2.2 billion and 

funded exposure was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2011.   
 
Additionally, the Bancorp was within its established country 

exposure limits for all European countries.  
Certain European countries have been experiencing increased 
levels of stress throughout 2011 in
cluding Portugal, Ireland, Italy, 
Greece and Spain.  The Bancorp™s total exposure to businesses 

domiciled or owned by companies an
d financial institutions in these 
countries was approximately $138 
million and funded exposure was 
$72 million as of December 31, 2011.  The following table provides

  Analysis of Nonperforming Assets 
Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for 

which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal 

and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial and credit card 
loans which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a 
performing asset; restructured consumer loans which are 90 days 
past due based on the restructured terms unless the loan is both 

well-secured and in the process of collection; and certain other 

assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A 

summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 45. 

Residential mortgage loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status 

when principal and interest payments have become past due 150 days unless such loans are both well secured and in the process of 
collection. Residential mortgage 
loans may stay on nonperforming 
status for an extended time as the 
foreclosure process typically lasts longer than 180 days. Typically, home equity loans and leases are 
reported on nonaccrual status if principal or interest has been in 

default for 180 days or more unless the loan is both well secured 

and in the process of collection. Automobile and other consumer 

loans and leases that have been modified in a TDR and 

subsequently become past due 90 days are placed on nonaccrual 
status. Credit card loans that have been modified in a TDR are 
classified as nonaccrual unless such loans have a sustained 
repayment performance of six months or greater and the Bancorp is 

reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with the 

restructured terms. Well secured loans are collateralized by 

perfected security interests in real and/or personal property for 
which the Bancorp estimates proceeds from sale would be sufficient 
to recover the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance of 
the loan and pay all costs to se
ll the collateral. The Bancorp 
considers a loan in the process of collection if collection efforts or 
legal action is proceeding and the Bancorp expects to collect funds 

sufficient to bring the loan current or recover the entire outstanding 

principal and accrued interest b
alance. When a loan is placed on 
nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest, amortization of loan 

premiums, accretion of loan discounts and amortization or accretion of deferred net loan fees or costs are discontinued and previously 

accrued, but unpaid interest is reversed. Commercial loans on 

nonaccrual status are reviewed for impairment at least quarterly. If 
the principal or a portion of the principal is deemed a loss, the loss 

amount is charged off to the ALLL.  
Total nonperforming assets, including loans held for sale, were 
$2.0 billion at December 31 2011 compared to $2.5 billion at 

December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, $138 million of 
nonaccrual loans, consisting primarily
 of real estate secured loans, 
were held for sale, compared to $294 million at December 31, 2010.  
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     61 
 Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans, leases and 
other assets, including OREO and nonaccrual loans held for sale as 
of December 31, 2011 were 2.32%, compared to 3.08% as of 

December 31, 2010. Excluding nonaccrual loans held for sale, 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans, leases and other 
assets, including OREO was 2.23% as of December 31, 2011, 

compared to 2.79% as of December 31, 2010. The composition of 
nonaccrual loans and leases continues to be concentrated in real 

estate as 69% of nonaccrual loans an
d leases were secured by real 

estate as of December 31, 2011 compared to 66% as of December 

31, 2010.  Commercial nonperforming loans and leases were $1.2 billion 
at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $312 million from December 

31, 2010, due to the impact of loss mitigation actions and 

moderation in general economic conditions. Excluding commercial 

nonperforming loans and leases held for sale, commercial 

nonperforming loans and leases at December 2011 decreased $156 

million compared to December 31, 2010. The decrease from 
December 31, 2010 was due to a continued decrease in new 

nonaccruals and an increase in paydowns and payoffs in 2011 due to 
improved delinquency metrics and an improvement in underlying 
loss trends. The Bancorp transferred commercial loans with a carrying balance of $961 million, prio
r to transfer, to held for sale during the third quarter of 2010, of which $694 million were 

nonperforming. At December 31, 2011, the remaining carrying 

balance of these loans was $67 million.  
Consumer nonperforming loans and leases were $380 million 
at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $86 million from December 31, 
2010. The decrease was mainly due to a $83 million decrease in other consumer loans and leases due primarily to charge-offs taken 
on certain consumer loans acquired during the fourth quarter of 

2010 as the result of a foreclosure on a commercial loan 

collateralized by individual consumer
 loans. These loans were fully 
charged off as of December 31, 2011. Home equity nonaccrual 

levels remain modest as the Bancorp continues to fully charge-off a 
high proportion of the severely delinquent loans at 180 days past 
due. Geography continues to be a large driver of nonaccrual activity 
as Florida properties represent approximately 16% and 8% of 
residential mortgage and home equity balances, respectively, but 
represent 45% and 16% of nonaccrual loans for each category. 

Consumer restructured loans on accrual status totaled $1.6 billion at 

December 31, 2011 and 2010. As of December 31, 2011, redefault 

rates, defined as 30 days delinquent, on restructured residential 

mortgage were 29% and home equity loans and credit card loans 
were each 16%. OREO and other repossessed property was $378 million at 
December 31, 2011, compared to $494 million at December 31, 2010. The decrease from December 31, 2010 was due to the sale of 
large OREO properties and improvements in general economic 

conditions during 2011. The Bancorp recognized $171 million and 
$264 million in losses on the sale or write-down of OREO 

properties in 2011 and 2010, respectively. These losses are primarily 
reflective of the continued stress in the Michigan and Florida 
markets for commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans as 
Michigan and Florida represented 16% and 26%, respectively, of 

total OREO losses in 2011 compared with 12% and 14%, 

respectively, in 2010. Properties in Michigan and Florida accounted 

for 42% of foreclosed real estate at December 31, 2011, compared 

to 49% at December 31, 2010.  
In 2011 and 2010, approximately $125 million and $206 
million, respectively, of interest income would have been recorded if 

the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual 

status had been current in accordance with their original terms. Although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying 

nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full 

amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally 

carried below their principal balance. MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  (a) For 2010, nonaccrual loans and leases reflect a reclassification 
of $84 million in nonperforming loans from commercial and indu
strial loans to other consumer loans and leases which occurred after the 
Bancorp™s Form 8-K was filed on January 19, 2011. This reclassifi
cation was primarily a result of the determination that consum
er loans obtained in the foreclosure of a commercial loan were more 
appropriately categorized as other consumer loans an
d leases in accordance with regulatory guidance.
 (b) During 2009, the Bancorp modified its cons
umer nonaccrual policy to exclude TDR loan
s that were less than 90 days past due beca
use they were performing in accor
dance with the restructured terms. 
For comparability purposes, prior periods were
 adjusted to reflect this reclassification.
 (c) Excludes nonaccrual loans held for sale.
 (d) Information for all periods presented excludes 
advances made pursuant to servicing agreements to GNMA mortgage loan pools whose
 repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration 
or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. As of 
December 31, 2011
, 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007 these advances were 
$309, $279, $130, $40, and $25, respectively. The 
Bancorp recognized immaterial credit losses for the year ended De
cember 31, 2011 and $2 million for 2010 due to claim denials a
nd curtailments associated with these advances.

 If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the Bancorp may 
consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan 

to maximize collection of amounts due. Typically, these 

modifications reduce the loan interest rate, extend the loan term, or 
in limited circumstances, reduce the principal balance of the loan. 
These modifications are classified as TDRs. 
At the time of modification, the Bancorp maintains certain 
consumer loan TDRs (including residential mortgage loans, home 
equity loans, and other consumer loans) on accrual status, provided 

there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance 

according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-

documented credit evaluation. Commercial loan TDRs and credit 
card TDRs are classified as nonaccrual loans and are typically 
returned to accrual status upon 
a six month period of sustained 
performance under the restructured terms. The following table 

summarizes TDRs by loan type and delinquency status.

 Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs were 149 bps and 302 bps of average loans and 

leases for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, 

respectively. Table 48 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases 

outstanding by loan category. 
The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs to 
average commercial loans and leases decreased to 126 bps during 2011 compared to 310 bps in 2010, as a result of decreases in net 

charge-offs of $810 million. Decreases in net charge-offs were 

realized across all commercial loan ty
pes and were primarily due to 
improvements in general economic conditions and previous actions 
taken by the Bancorp to address problem loans. Actions taken by 
the Bancorp include suspending homebuilder and developer lending in 2007 and non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending in 

2008 and tightened underwriting standards across all commercial 

loan product offerings. In addi
tion, the Bancorp implemented other 
loss mitigation strategies that included the previously mentioned sale 

of troubled loans during the third quarter of 2010. Net charge-offs 

for 2011 related to non-owner occupied commercial real estate were 

$211 million compared to $625 million in 2010. Net charge-offs 

related to non-owner occupied commercial real estate are recorded 

in the commercial mortgage loans and commercial construction 

loans captions in Table 48. Net charge-offs on these loans 

represented 38% of total commercial 
loan and lease net charge-offs in 2011 and 46% in 2010.  MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
64     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 The ratio of consumer loan 
and lease net charge-offs to average consumer loans and leases decreased to 179 bps in 2011 
compared to 292 bps in 2010. Resi
dential mortgage loan net charge-
offs, which typically involve partial charge-offs based upon 
appraised values of underlying collateral, decreased $266 million 
from the prior year as a result of improvements in delinquencies and 

a decrease in the average loss recorded per charge-off.  Additionally, 

the prior year included $123 million in net charge-offs that were 

recorded on residential mortgage portfolio loans sold during the 

third quarter of 2010. The Bancorp™
s Florida and Michigan markets 
accounted for 58% and 72% of net charge-offs on residential 

mortgage loans in the portfolio in
 2011 and 2010, respectively. Fifth 
Third expects the composition of the residential mortgage portfolio 

to improve as it continues to retain high quality, shorter duration 

residential mortgage loans that are originated through its branch 

network as a low-cost, refinance product of conforming residential 

mortgage loans.  Home equity net charge-offs decreased $44 million compared 
to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in net charge-offs in the 

Michigan market and reduced net charge-offs of brokered home 
equity products. Management responded to the performance of the 
brokered home equity portfolio by
 eliminating this channel of 
origination in 2007. In addition, 
management actively manages lines 
of credit and makes reductions in lending limits when it believes it is 
necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property 
devaluation.  
Automobile loan net charge-offs decreased $35 million 
compared to 2010, due to the origination of high credit quality loans 
as a result of tighter underwriting standards and higher resale on 

automobiles sold at auction. Credit card net charge-offs decreased $57 million from 2010 reflecting improving delinquency trends, aggressive line 

management, and stabilization in unemployment levels. The Bancorp utilizes a risk-adjusted pricing methodology to ensure 

adequate compensation is received for those products that have 

higher credit costs. 
Other consumer loan net char
ge-offs increased $56 million 
compared to 2010 due to charge-o
ffs associated with certain 
consumer loans that were acquired during the fourth quarter of 
2010 when the Bancorp foreclosed on a commercial loan that was 

collateralized by individual consumer
 loans. These loans were fully 
charged off as of December 31, 2011.

          Allowance for Credit Losses 
The allowance for credit losses is
 comprised of the ALLL and the 
reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL provides coverage 

for probable and estimable losses in the loan and lease portfolio. 
The Bancorp evaluates the ALLL each quarter to determine its 

adequacy to cover inherent losses. Several factors are taken into 

consideration in the determinati
on of the overall ALLL, including 
an unallocated component. These factors include, but are not 
limited to, the overall risk profile of the loan and lease portfolios, net charge-off experience, the extent
 of impaired loans and leases, the level of nonaccrual loans and leases, the level of 90 days past 
due loans and leases and the overall percentage level of the ALLL. 
The Bancorp also considers overall asset quality trends, credit 

administration and portfolio 
management practices, risk 
identification practices, credit po
licy and underwriting practices, overall portfolio growth, portfolio concentrations and current 
national and local economic conditions that might impact the 
portfolio. See the Critical Accounting Policies section for more 
information. The ALLL attributable to the portion of the residential and 
consumer loan and lease portfolio that has not been restructured is 

determined on a pooled basis with the segmentation being based on 

the similarity of credit risk characteristics. Loss factors for real estate 

backed consumer loans are developed for each pool based on the 
trailing twelve month historical loss rate, as adjusted for certain 
prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment 
factors. The prescriptive loss rate factors and qualitative adjustments 

are designed to reflect risks associated with current conditions and 

trends which are not believed to be fully reflected in the trailing 
twelve month historical loss rate. For real estate backed consumer 

loans, the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for 

delinquency trends, LTV trends, re
freshed FICO score trends and 
product mix, and the qualitative factors include adjustments for 
credit administration and portfolio management practices, credit 
policy and underwriting practices and the national and local

footprint when determining the national and local economy 

qualitative factor. The Bancorp also considers the volatility of 
collateral valuation trends when
 determining the unallocated 
component of the ALLL.

 95     In 2011, the Bancorp did not substantively change any material 

aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the ALLL and 

there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation 

techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the 

determination of the current period allowance. In addition to the 

ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments 

recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 

methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is 
similar to the Bancorp™s methodo
logy for determining the ALLL. 
The provision for unfunded commitments is included in other 
noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Certain inherent, but unconfirmed losses are probable within 
the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp™s current methodology 

for determining the level of losses is based on historical loss rates, 

current credit grades, specific allocation on impaired commercial 

credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. 
Due to the heavy reliance on realized historical losses and the credit 
grade rating process, the model-derived required reserves tend to 

slightly lag behind the deterioration in the portfolio, in a stable or 

deteriorating credit environment, and tend not to be as responsive 

when improved conditions have presented themselves. Given these 

model limitations, the qualitative adjustment factors may be 

incremental or decremental to the 
quantitative model results.  
An unallocated component to the ALLL is maintained to 
recognize the imprecision in esti
mating and measuring loss. The unallocated allowance as a percent of
 total portfolio loans and leases 

at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was 0.17% and 0.19%, respectively. 

The unallocated allowance increased from five percent at December 

31, 2010 to six percent of the 
total allowance for December 31, 
2011. The increase in the unallocat
ed allowance as a percentage of 
the total allowance was driven by additional sustained market 

volatility in the U.S. markets that has provided indications that loss 
events may be occurring at a rate greater than the rate captured 
within the Bancorp™s model.  
As shown in Table 50, the ALLL 
as a percent of the total loan and lease portfolio was 2.78% at
 December 31, 2011, compared to 3.88% at December 31, 2010. The ALLL was $2.3 billion as of 

December 31, 2011, compared to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2010. 

The decrease is reflective of a number of factors including decreases 

in nonperforming loans and leases, improved delinquency metrics in 

commercial and consumer loans and leases and improvement in 
underlying loss trends.  
The Bancorp™s determination of the ALLL for commercial 
loans is sensitive to the risk grades
 it assigns to these loans. In the 
event that 10% of commercial loans in each risk category would 

experience a downgrade of one ri
sk category, the allowance for 
commercial loans would increase by approximately $132 million at 

December 31, 2011. In addition, the Bancorp™s determination of the 

allowance for residential and consumer
 loans is sensitive to changes 
in estimated loss rates. In the ev
ent that estimated loss rates would 
increase by 10%, the allowance for residential and consumer loans 

would increase by approximately $59 million at December 31, 2011. 

As several qualitative and quantitative factors are considered in 

determining the ALLL, these sensitiv
ity analyses do not necessarily 
reflect the nature and extent of 
future changes in the ALLL. They 
are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes 
to risk grades and estimated loss rates and do not imply any 

expectation of future deterioration in
 the risk ratings or loss rates. 
Given current processes employed by the Bancorp, management 

believes the risk grades and estimated loss rates currently assigned 

are appropriate. 
The Bancorp continually reviews its credit administration and 
loan and lease portfolio and makes changes based on the 

performance of its products. As previously discussed, management 

discontinued the origination of brokered home equity products at 

the end of 2007, suspended homebuilder lending in 2007 and new 
commercial non-owner occupied real estate lending in 2008, and 
tightened underwriting standards across both the commercial and 

consumer loan product offerings.

          MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 
Market risk arises from the potential for market fluctuations in 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices that may 
result in potential reductions in net income. Interest rate risk, a 

component of market risk, is the exposure to adverse changes in net 

interest income or financial position due to changes in interest rates. 

Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in 

terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk can occur 
for any one or more of the following reasons: 
  Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times;  Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts; or  
 The expected maturity of various assets or liabilities may 

shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. 
 In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on net 
interest income, interest rates can indirectly impact earnings through 
their effect on loan demand, credit losses, mortgage originations, the 
value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorp™s 
earnings. Stability of the Bancorp™s net income is largely dependent 

upon the effective management of interest rate risk. Management continually reviews the Bancorp™
s balance sheet composition and 
earnings flows and models the interest rate risk, and possible actions 

to reduce this risk, given numerous
 possible future interest rate 

scenarios. 
  Net Interest Income Simulation Model
 The Bancorp utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to 
identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII 
simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to 

changing interest rates. The model is based on contractual and 
assumed cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the 

Bancorp™s financial instruments and incorporates market-based 

assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain asse
ts and liabilities. The model also 
includes senior management™s project
ions of the future volume and 
pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well 

as other pertinent assumptions. Actual results may differ from these 

simulated results due to timing, ma
gnitude and frequency of interest 
rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and 

management strategies. The Bancorp™s Executive ALCO, which includes senior 
management representatives and is accountable to the Enterprise 
Risk Management Committee, monito
rs and manages interest rate 
risk within Board approved policy limits. In addition to the risk 
management activities of ALCO, 
the Bancorp has a Market Risk 
Management function as part of ERM that provides independent 

oversight of market risk activities. The Bancorp™s interest rate risk 
exposure is currently evaluated by 
measuring the anticipated change 
in net interest income over 12-month and 24-month horizons 

assuming a 100 bps parallel ramped increase and a 200 bps parallel 

ramped increase in interest rates. The Fed Funds interest rate, 
targeted by the Federal Reserve at a range of 0% to 0.25%, is currently set at a level that would be negative in parallel ramped

 decrease scenarios; therefore, thos
e scenarios were omitted from the 
interest rate risk analyses at December 31, 2011. In accordance with 
the current policy, the rate movements are assumed to occur over 

one year and are sustained thereafter. 
At December 31, 2011, the Bancorp™s interest rate risk profile 
reflects a neutral position in year one and slight asset sensitivity in 

year two. The following table s
hows the Bancorp's estimated net 
interest income sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of

31, 2011 for the +200 and +100 basis point scenarios shows a 

modest decline in asset sensitivity compared with December 31, 

2010. The primary factors contributing to this change are an increase in fixed-rate loans partially offset by growth in deposits.  Economic Value of Equity
 The Bancorp also utilizes EVE as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk. Whereas the net interest income simulation model 

highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, the EVE 

analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life 

of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The EVE of the 
balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present 

value of asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value 
of liability cash flows. The sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level 

of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE 

values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the 

growth assumptions used in the earnings simulation model. As with 
the earnings simulation model, a
ssumptions about the timing and 
variability of existing balance sheet
 cash flows are critical in the 
EVE analysis. Particularly important are assumptions driving 

prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of 
transaction deposit portfolios. The following table shows the 

Bancorp™s EVE sensitivity profile as of December 31:

                       The EVE at risk profile suggests slight asset sensitivity from market 

rate increases through the +200 
bps scenario. The EVE at risk 
reported at December 31, 2011 for the +200 basis points scenario 
shows a change to a modest asset sensitive position compared to December 31, 2010.  The primary factors contributing to the change 

are the decline in market interest rates over the course of 2011 and 

growth in core deposits, partially offs
et by the impact of the increase 
in fixed-rate loans. 
 While an instantaneous shift in 
interest rates is used in this 
analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes 

that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest 
impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash 
flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE 
does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be 

impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). 

Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future 

balance sheet growth, changes in 
product mix, changes in yield 

curve relationships and changing product spreads that could 

mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The NII 
simulation and EVE analyses do not
 necessarily include certain 
actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in 
response to anticipated changes in interest rates. 
The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to LIBOR and 
Prime basis risks, nonparallel shifts in the yield curve and embedded 
options risk. In addition, the 
impact on NII and EVE of extreme 
changes in interest rates is modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs 

the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios. 
  
   Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 
An integral component of the Bancorp™s interest rate risk 
management strategy is its use of de
rivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market 
interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp 

may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include 

interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward 

contracts, principal only swaps,
 options, swaptions and TBA™s.  
 As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its 
mortgage banking activity, the Bancorp enters into forward 
contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically 
hedge interest rate lock commitments that are also considered free-standing derivatives. Additionally, the Bancorp economically hedges 
its exposure to mortgage loans he
ld for sale through the use of 
forward contracts and mortgage options.  
The Bancorp also establishes derivative contracts with major 
financial institutions to economic
ally hedge significant exposures assumed in commercial customer accommodation derivative 
contracts. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to 
protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from 
the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their 

contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral 

arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. For 

further information including the notional amount and fair values of 

these derivatives, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated 

Financial Statements.

    Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Interest Rate Risk 
The net carrying amount of the residential MSR portfolio was $681 

million and $822 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, 
respectively. The value of servic
ing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, 

as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of 
refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines 

because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. The 

Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its 

mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk 
associated with changes in the valu
e of its MSR portfolio as a result 
of changing interest rates. 
Mortgage rates decreased during both 2011 and 2010.  These 
decreases caused modeled prepayment speeds to increase, which led 
to $242 million in temporary impairment on servicing rights during 

the year ended 2011, compared to $36 million in temporary 

impairment in 2010. Servicing rights are deemed temporarily 

impaired when a borrower™s loan ra
te is distinctly higher than 
prevailing rates. Temporary impairment on servicing rights is reversed when the prevailing rates return to a level commensurate 

with the borrower™s loan rate. Offsetting the mortgage servicing 

rights valuation, the Bancorp recognized net gains of $354 million 

and $123 million on its non-qualifying hedging strategy for the years 

ended 2011 and 2010, respectively. The net gains include net gains 

from the sale of securities related to the Bancorp™s non-qualifying 
hedging strategy of $9 million and $14 million for 2011 and 2010, 
respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Bancorp assessed the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic 
environment.  Based on this review, the Bancorp adjusted its MSR 
hedging strategy to exclude the hedging of MSRs related to certain 
mortgage loans originated in
 2008 and prior, representing 

approximately 25% of the carrying value of the MSR portfolio as of 

December 31, 2011.  The prepayment behavior of these loans is 

expected to be less sensitive to ch
anges in interest rates as borrower credit characteristics and home price values have a greater impact 

based on changes in the market and underwriting environment. 

Thus, the predictive power of traditional prepayment models on 
these loans may not be reliable, which reduces the effectiveness of interest rate based hedge strategies. The Bancorp is exposed to 

prepayment risk on these loans in the event borrowers refinance at 

higher than expected levels due to government intervention or other 

factors.  The Bancorp continues to monitor the performance of 

these MSRs and may decide to hedge this portion of the MSR 

portfolio in future periods. See Note 12 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statemen
ts for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge interest rate risk 

on MSRs.
  Foreign Currency Risk 
The Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts 

to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The 

derivatives are classified as fr
ee-standing instruments with the 
revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income 

in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the 
Bancorp™s foreign denominated loans at December 31, 2011 and 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
70     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 2010 was approximately $374 million and $283 million, respectively. 
The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the 

benefit of commercial customers involved in international trade to 

hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Bancorp 
has internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not 
being taken in providing this serv
ice to customers. These controls 
include an independent determination of currency volatility and 
credit equivalent exposure on these 
contracts, counterparty credit 
approvals and country limits.   LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 
The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to 

meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of 

deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating 
liquidity risk is accomplished by 
maintaining liquid assets in the 
form of investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused 

borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent 
growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and 
commitments to make future payments under contracts is included 

in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that 
assesses the liquidity needs unde
r various scenarios of market conditions, asset growth and cred
it rating downgrades. The plan 
includes liquidity stress testing which measures various sources and uses of funds under the different scenarios. The contingency plan 
provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and 
available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected 

liquidity needs and to cover unanti
cipated events that could affect 
liquidity. 

 Sources of Funds The Bancorp™s primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from 

loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales 
and maturities, the sale or securi
tization of loans and leases and 
funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public 
and private debt offerings. Projected contractual maturities from loan and lease 
repayments are included in Ta
ble 53 of the Market Risk 
Management section of MD&A. Of th
e $15.4 billion of securities in 
the Bancorp™s available-for-sale portfolio at December 31, 2011, 
$4.4 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the 
next 12 months and an additional $3.0 billion is expected to be 
received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on 

the Bancorp™s securities portfolio
, see the Securities section of 
MD&A.  Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorp™s ability to 
sell or securitize loan and lease assets. In order to reduce the 

exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the 

Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for 
several types of interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-
term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans 

underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold 

for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as residential 

mortgages, certain commercial loans,
 home equity loans, automobile 
loans and other consumer loans are 
also capable of being securitized 

or sold. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the 

Bancorp sold loans totaling $15.2 billion and $18.2 billion, 
respectively. For further information on the transfer of financial 

assets, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements. Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a 
sizeable source of relatively stable and low cost funds. The 

Bancorp™s average core deposits and shareholders™ equity funded 

81% of its average total assets during 2011, compared to 80% in 

2010. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses 
a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which 
include the use of the FHLB system.  
 
  
 
 
 
Certificates of deposit carrying a balance of $100,000 or more 
and deposits in the Bancorp™s foreign branch located in the Cayman 

Islands are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset growth. 
Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and 
manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs.  
The Bancorp has approximately $7
.2 billion of unsecured long-
term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Long-term debt 

with a principal balance of $8 million will mature during 2012. As of 

December 31, 2011, $6.1 billion of de
bt or other securities were 
available for issuance under the current Bancorp™s Board of 

Directors™ authorizations and the Ba
ncorp is authorized to file any 
necessary registration statements with the SEC to permit ready 

access to the public securities 
markets; however, access to these 
markets may depend on market c
onditions. The Bancorp also has 
$19.0 billion of funding available for issuance through private 

offerings of debt securities purs
uant to its bank note program and 
currently has approximately $31.0 
billion of borrowing capacity 
available through secured borrowi
ng sources including the FHLB and FRB.  
On January 25, 2011, the Bancorp raised $1.7 billion in new 
common equity through the issuance of 121,428,572 shares of 
common stock in an underwritten offering at an initial price of 

$14.00 per share. Additionally, on January 25, 2011, the Bancorp 

sold $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior 

Notes due January 25, 2016. Notes 16 and 23 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information 

regarding the Senior Notes and common equity offerings, 
respectively.   Credit Ratings 
The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp are impacted 
by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorp™s credit ratings 

could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its 

borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorp™s 

financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high 

credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong 

credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in 

addition to disciplined liquidi
ty monitoring procedures. 
The Bancorp™s senior debt credit ratings are summarized in 
Table 55. The ratings reflect th
e ratings agencies view on the 
Bancorp™s capacity to meet financial commitments. * Additional 

information on senior debt credit ratings is as follows: 

  Moody™s ﬁBaa1ﬂ rating is considered a medium-grade 
obligation and is the fourth highest ranking within its 
overall classification system; 
 Standard & Poor™s ﬁBBBﬂ rating indicates the obligor™s 

capacity to meet its financial
 commitment is adequate and 
is the fourth highest ranking within its overall 
classification system;  Fitch Ratings™ ﬁA-ﬂ rating is considered high credit quality 
and is the third highest ranking within its overall 
classification system; and  DBRS Ltd.™s ﬁA (low)ﬂ rating is considered satisfactory 

credit quality and is the third highest ranking within its 
overall classification system.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  

Management regularly reviews the Bancorp™s capital position to help 
ensure it is appropriately posi
tioned under various operating 
environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee, 

which is responsible for all capital related decisions. The Capital 

Committee makes recommendations to management involving 

capital actions. These recommendati
ons are reviewed and approved 
by the Enterprise Risk Management Committee. 
 2011 Capital Actions 
On January 25, 2011, the Bancorp raised $1.7 billion in new 

common equity through the issuance of 121,428,572 shares of 
common stock in an underwritten offering at an initial price of 

$14.00 per share. On January 24, 
2011, the underwriters exercised 
their option to purchase an additional 12,142,857 shares at the 

offering price of $14.00 per share. 
In connection with this exercise, 
the Bancorp elected that all such a
dditional shares be sold and the 
Bancorp entered into a forward sale agreement which resulted in a 
final net payment of 959,821 shares on February 4, 2011. 
On February 2, 2011, the Bancorp redeemed all 136,320 shares 
of its Series F Preferred Stock held by the U.S. Treasury totaling 
$3.4 billion. The Bancorp used the net proceeds from the common 

stock and senior notes offerings previously discussed and other 

funds to redeem the Series F Preferred Stock. In connection with 

the redemption of the Series F Preferred Stock, the Bancorp 

accelerated the accretion of the remaining issuance discount on the 
Series F Preferred Stock and recorded a corresponding reduction in 

retained earnings of $153 million. In addition, dividends of $15 

million were paid on February 2, 2011 when the Series F Preferred 

Stock was redeemed. 
On March 16, 2011, the Bancorp repurchased the warrant 
issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP for $280 million, which 

was recorded as a reduction to capital surplus in the Bancorp™s 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
On March 18, 2011, the Bancorp announced that the FRB did 
not object to the Bancorp™s capital plan submitted under the FRB 

2011 CCAR. Pursuant to this plan, 
in the second quarter of 2011, 
the Bancorp redeemed $452 million of certain trust preferred 

securities, at par, classified as long-term debt. The trust preferred 
securities redeemed related to the Fifth Third Capital Trust VII, 

First National Bankshares Statutory Trust I and R&G Capital Trust 
II, LLT. As a result of these redemptions the Bancorp recorded a $6 

million gain on the extinguishment 
within other noninterest expense 
in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The trust preferred 

securities were a component of Tier I capital: however, these 

securities are being phased out of 
Tier I capital by the Dodd-Frank 

Act as discussed below. Pursuant to the Bancorp™s capital plan discussed above, the 
Bancorp redeemed certain trust preferred securities on September 
19, 2011, totaling $40 million, which related to the R&G Crown Cap 
Trust IV and First National Banksh
ares Statutory Trust II. As a 
result of the redemption the Bancorp recorded a $1 million gain on 
the extinguishment within other noninterest expense in the 

Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, on October 24, 

2011 the Bancorp redeemed certain trust preferred securities 

totaling $25 million, which related 
to the R&G Crown Cap Trust I.

MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
72     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 Capital Ratios 
The U.S banking agencies established quantitative measures that 
assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items and also 
define and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. The U.S. 
banking agencies define ﬁwell capitalizedﬂ ratios for Tier I and total 
risk-based capital as 6% and 10%, respectively. The Bancorp 

exceeded these ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ ratios for all periods presented. 
The Basel II advanced approach framework was finalized by U.S. banking agencies in 2007. Co
re banks, defined as those with 
consolidated total assets in excess of $250 billion or on balance 

sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion were required to adopt the 

advanced approach effective April 1, 2008. The Bancorp is not 
subject to the requirements of Basel II. 
The 19 large bank holding companies assessed under SCAP 
were required to demonstrate that they met the 4% Tier I common 
equity ratio threshold for the period evaluated in the SCAP. The 

Bancorp exceeded this threshold for all periods presented. The 

Bancorp™s Tier I common equity ratio was 9.35% as of December 

31, 2011, compared to 7.48% as of December 31, 2010. The 

Bancorp manages the adequacy of its capital, including Tier I 
common equity, by conducting ongoing internal stress tests and 
ensuring the results are properly cons
idered in capital planning. It is 
the intent of the Bancorp™s capital planning process to ensure that 

the Bancorp™s capital positions rem
ain in excess of well-capitalized 
standards and any other regulatory requirements. 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires more stringent prudential 
standards, including capital and 
liquidity requirements, for larger 
institutions. It addresses the quality of capital components by 
limiting the degree to which certain hybrid instruments can be 
included. The Dodd-Frank Act will phase out the inclusion of 

certain trust preferred securities as a component of Tier I capital 

beginning January 1, 2013. At December 31, 2011, the Bancorp™s 

Tier I capital included $2.2 billion of trust preferred securities 

representing approximately 214 bps of risk-weighted assets. 
In December of 2010 and revised in June of 2011, the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision issued Basel III, a global 
regulatory framework, to enhance the international capital 

standards. It imposes a stricter de
finition of capital, with greater 
reliance on common equity and sets higher minimum capital 

requirements. It creates a new capital measure, Tier I common 

equity, which proposes changes to the current calculation of the 

Tier I common equity ratio by the Bancorp and several other 

financial institutions. The U.S. bank
ing agencies are in the process of developing rules to implement the new capital standards as part 
of the Collins Amendment wi
thin the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Management believes that the Bancorp™s capital levels will continue to exceed U.S. ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ st
andards, including the adoption  
  
of U.S. rules that incorporate changes under Basel III, to the extent 

applicable. The FRB provided final rules of the 2012 CCAR on November 22, 2011. The CCAR requires th
e 19 largest Bank Holding 
Companies submit a capital plan to the FRB by January 9, 2012. 

The mandatory elements of the capital plan are an assessment of the 

expected use and sources of capital over the planning horizon, a 

description of all planned capital ac
tions over the planning horizon, a discussion of any expected changes to the Bancorp™s business plan 

that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy or 

liquidity, a detailed description of the Bancorp™s process for 
assessing capital adequacy and the Bancorp™s capital policy.  
The FRB™s review of the capital plan will assess the 
comprehensiveness of the capital plan, the reasonableness of the 
assumptions and the analysis underlying the capital plan and a 

review of the robustness of the capi
tal adequacy process, the capital 
policy and the Bancorp™s ability to maintain capital above the 
minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier 1 common ratio 

of 5 percent on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful 
conditions throughout the planning horizon. Following the FRB™s 
assessment of the capital plan, it will either object or provide a 

notice of non-objection to the submi
tted capital plan by March 15, 
2012.  Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program  
The Bancorp™s common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase 

program reflect its earnings outlook
, desired payout ratios, the need 
to maintain adequate capital levels
, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends, the need to comply with safe and sound banking 

practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. 
The Bancorp received a notice of
 non-objection to its dividend 
distribution proposal within its capital plan submitted to the FRB 
pursuant to the 2011 CCAR. The Ba
ncorp declared dividends per 
common share of $0.28 and $0.04 during the years ended December 

31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  
The Bancorp submitted a capital plan to the FRB on January 9, 
2012 in accordance with the requirements of the 2012 CCAR. 

Following the FRB™s assessment of the capital plan, it will object or 

provide notice of non-objection to the submitted capital plan by March 15, 2012. The Bancorp™s repurchase of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 is shown in the table 

below. The Bancorp™s Board of Directors had previously authorized 
management to purchase 30 million shares of the Bancorp™s common stock through the open market or in any private 

transaction. The amounts below reflect the remaining shares from

      Fifth Third Bancorp     73 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
In the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into financial 
transactions to extend credit 
and various forms of commitments 
and guarantees that may be considered off-balance sheet 

arrangements. These transactions involve varying elements of 

market, credit and liquidity risk. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. A 

discussion of these transactions is as follows: 

 
Residential Mortgage Loan Sales 

Conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third 
parties are generally sold with representation and warranty recourse provisions. Such provisions include the loan™s compliance with 
applicable loan criteria, includ
ing certain documentation standards 
per agreements with unrelated third parties. Additional reasons for 
the Bancorp having to repurchase the loans include appraisal 

standards with the collateral, fraud related to the loan application 
and the rescission of mortgage insurance. Under these provisions, 

the Bancorp is required to repurchase any previously sold loan for 
which the representation or warranty of the Bancorp proves to be 

inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. As of December 31, 2011 and 
2010, the Bancorp maintained reserves related to these loans sold 
with the representation and warrant
y recourse provisions totalling 
$55 million and $85 million, respectively, included in other liabilities 

in the Bancorp™s Consolidated Balance Sheets. For further 
information on residential mortgage loans sold with representation 

and warranty recourse provisions, see Note 17 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.  
During 2011 and 2010, the Bancorp paid $63 million and $47 
million, respectively, in the form of make whole payments and 
repurchased $122 million and $83 million, respectively, in 

outstanding principal of loans to satisfy investor demands. Total 
repurchase demand requests during 2011 and 2010 were $350 

million and $365 million, respective
ly. Total outstanding repurchase 
demand inventory was $66 million at December 31, 2011 compared 
to $162 million at December 31, 2010. The Bancorp sold certain residential mortgage loans in the 
secondary market with credit recourse. In the event of any customer 
default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, the Bancorp is 

required to reimburse the third party. The maximum amount of 

credit risk in the event of non-performance by the underlying 

borrowers is equivalent to the 
total outstanding balance. In the 
event of non-performance, the Bancor
p has rights to the underlying collateral value securing the loan. At December 31, 2011 the 

outstanding balances on these loans sold with credit recourse was 

$772 million compared to $916 million at December 31, 2010. The 

Bancorp maintained an estimated credit loss reserve on these loans 

sold with credit recourse of $17 million at December 31, 2011 and 
$16 million at December 31, 2010; recorded in other liabilities in the 

Consolidated Balance Sheets. To de
termine the credit loss reserve, the Bancorp used an approach that is consistent with its overall approach in estimating credit 
losses for various categories of residential mortgage loans held in its loan portfolio. For further 
information on residential mortgage loans sold with credit recourse, 
see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 
Private Mortgage Insurance 

For certain mortgage loans originated by the Bancorp, borrowers 

may be required to obtain PMI provided by third-party insurers. In 
some instances, these insurers cede a portion of the PMI premiums 
to the Bancorp, and the Bancorp provides reinsurance coverage 

within a specified range of the total PMI coverage. The Bancorp™s 

reinsurance coverage typically ranges from 5% to 10% of the total 

PMI coverage.  
The Bancorp™s maximum exposure in the event of 
nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the 

Bancorp's total outstanding reinsurance coverage, which was $77 
million at December 31, 2011 and $115 million at December 31, 

2010. The Bancorp maintained a reserve, included in other liabilities 
in the Bancorp™s Consolidated B
alance Sheets, related to exposures within the reinsurance portfolio of $27 million as of December 31, 
2011 and $42 million as of December 31, 2010. During the second 

quarter of 2009, the Bancorp suspended the practice of providing 

reinsurance of private mortgage insurance for newly originated 

mortgage loans. In the third quarter of 2010, the Bancorp allowed 

one of its third-party insurers to terminate its reinsurance agreement 

with the Bancorp, resulting in the Bancorp releasing collateral to the 
insurer in the form of investment 
securities and other assets with a 
carrying value of $19 million, and the insurer assuming the 
Bancorp™s obligations under the reinsurance agreement, resulting in 
a decrease to the Bancorp™s reserve liability of $20 million and 

decrease in the Bancorp™s maximum exposure of $53 million. In the 

second quarter of 2011, the Bancorp allowed one of its third-party 

insurers to terminate its reinsurance agreement with the Bancorp, 

resulting in the Bancorp releasing collateral to the insurer in the 
form of investment securities and other assets with a carrying value 

of $5 million, and the insurer assuming the Bancorp™s obligations 

under the reinsurance agreement, resulting in a decrease to the 

Bancorp™s reserve liability of $11 million and decrease in the 

Bancorp™s maximum exposure of $27 million. MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS 
The Bancorp has certain obligations and commitments to make 
future payments under contracts. The aggregate contractual 
obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011 are shown in 
Table 58. As of December 31, 2011, the Bancorp has unrecognized 

tax benefits that, if recognized, wo
uld impact the effective tax rate 
in future periods. Due to the un
certainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, all uncertain 

tax liabilities that have not been paid have been excluded from the 
Contractual Obligations and Other 
Commitments table. For further 
detail on the impact of income taxes see Note 20 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

   MANAGEMENT™S ASSESSMENT AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
      Fifth Third Bancorp     75 
 The Bancorp conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and wi
th the participation of the Bancorp™s management, including th
e Bancorp™s 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effect
iveness of the design and operation of the Bancorp™s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the S
ecurities Exchange Act). Based on the foregoing, as of the e
nd of the period covered by this report, the Bancorp™s Chie
f Executive Officer and Chief Financial Offi
cer concluded that the Bancorp™s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material re
spects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Ban
corp files and submits 
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and re
ported as and when required and information is accumulated and 
communicated to management on a timely basis. 
The management of Fifth Third Bancorp is responsible for establis
hing and maintaining adequate in
ternal control, designed to pr
ovide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United St
ates of America. The Bancorp™s management assessed the effectiven
ess of the Bancorp™s internal control over financial reporting as of Decemb
er 31, 2011. Management™s assessment is based on the criteria e
stablished in the 
Internal Control Š Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and was designed to 
provide reasonable assurance that the Bancorp maintained effect
ive internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
 2011. Based on 
this assessment, management believes that the Bancorp maintained
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of Dece
mber 31, 2011. 
The Bancorp™s independent registered public accounting firm, th
at audited the Bancorp™s consolidated financial statements inclu
ded in this annual 
report, has issued an audit report on our internal control over
 financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. This report appears on page 76 of the 
annual report. The Bancorp™s management also conducted an evaluation of internal 
control over financial reporting to determine whether any cha
nges 
occurred during the year covered by this report that have mate
rially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, t
he Bancorp™s internal 
control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, there has been no such chan
ge during the year covered by this repor
t.

 REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
76     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp: 
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
 Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the ﬁBancorpﬂ) as of Dec
ember 31, 2011, 
based on criteria established in 
Internal Control Š Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission. The Bancorp's management is responsible for maintain
ing effective internal control over financial reporting and for
 its assessment of 
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Ma
nagement™s Assessment as to the Effectiveness of 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
 express an opinion on the Bancorp's internal control over f
inancial reporting 
based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Pu
blic Company Accounting Oversigh
t Board (United States). Those
 standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtai
n reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control ov
er financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit in
cluded obtaining an understanding of internal control over finan
cial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operati
ng effectiveness of internal c
ontrol based on the 
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we consid
ered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit 
provides a 
reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A company's internal control over financial re
porting is a process designed by, or un
der the supervision of, the company's prin
cipal executive 
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected 
by the company's board of directors, ma
nagement, and other 
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial re
porting and the preparation of financial sta
tements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accep
ted accounting principles. A company's in
ternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable det
ail, accurately and fairly reflect the tra
nsactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounti
ng principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the com
pany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance re
garding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company's assets that could have a mater
ial effect on the financial statements. 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or imp
roper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, pr
ojections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over fina
ncial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that th
e degree of compliance with the po
licies or procedures may deteri
orate. In our opinion, the Bancorp maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of Dec
ember 31, 2011, 
based on the criteria established in 
Internal Control Š Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsor
ing Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Pu
blic Company Accounting Oversigh
t Board (United States), the co
nsolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 
of the Bancorp and our report dated February 29, 2012 expre
ssed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 Cincinnati, Ohio 
February 29, 2012 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp: 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the ﬁBancorpﬂ) as of Dece
mber 31, 2011 
and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity
, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period e
nded December 31, 
2011. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Bancorp's management. Our responsibility is to expr
ess an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Thos
e standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
 reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
 on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial st
atements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and sign
ificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audi
ts provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, such consolidated financ
ial statements present fairly, in all materi
al respects, the financial position of Fift
h Third Bancorp and subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of th
eir operations and their cash flows for each of the three year
s in the period ended 
December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles
 generally accepted in the United States of America. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Pu
blic Company Accounting Oversigh
t Board (United States), the Bancorp™s 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in 
Internal ControlŠIntegrated Framework 
issued 
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 29, 2012 expressed an unq
ualified 
opinion on the Bancorp's internal 
control over financial reporting.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
     Fifth Third Bancorp     81 
 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES 
Nature of Operations 
Fifth Third Bancorp, an Ohio cor
poration, conducts its principal lending, deposit gathering, transaction processing and service 
advisory activities through its banking and non-banking subsidiaries 
from banking centers located throughout the Midwestern and 
Southeastern regions of the United States.   
 Basis of Presentation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements
 include the accounts of the 
Bancorp and its majority-owned su
bsidiaries and VIEs in which the 
Bancorp has been determined to be the primary beneficiary. Other 

entities, including certain joint ventures, in which the Bancorp has 
the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and 
financial policies of the investee, but upon which the Bancorp does 

not possess control, are accounted for by the equity method and not 

consolidated. Those entities in which the Bancorp does not have the 

ability to exercise significant infl
uence are generally carried at the 
lower of cost or fair value. Intercompany transactions and balances 
have been eliminated. Certain prior period data has been reclassified 
to conform to current period presentation.  
 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions 

that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and 
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.  Cash and Due From Banks 
Cash and due from banks consist of currency and coin, cash items 

in the process of collection and due from banks. Currency and coin 
includes both U.S. and foreign currency owned and held at Fifth 
Third offices and that is in-transit
 to the FRB. Cash items in the 
process of collection include checks and drafts that are drawn on 

another depository institution or the FRB that are payable 

immediately upon presentation in the U.S. Balances due from banks 

include non-interest bearing balances that are funds on deposit at 

other depository institutions or the FRB. 
 Securities 
Securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or 

trading on the date of purchase. Only those securities which 

management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are 

classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. 

Securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management™s 
judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, 
changes in market conditions. Securities are classified as trading 
when bought and held principally 
for the purpose of selling them in 
the near term. Available-for-sale secu
rities are reported at fair value 
with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income 

taxes included in other comprehe
nsive income. Trading securities are reported at fair value with un
realized gains and losses included 
in noninterest income. The fair value of a security is determined 
based on quoted market prices. If 
quoted market prices are not 
available, fair value is determined based on quoted prices of similar 

instruments or discounted cash flow models that incorporate market 

inputs and assumptions includin
g discount rates, prepayment speeds, and loss rates. Realized securities gains or losses are 
reported within noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements 

of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific 

identification method.  
Available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities with 
unrealized losses are reviewed quarterly for possible OTTI. For debt 

securities, if the Bancorp intends to sell the debt security or will 

more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before 

recovery of the entire amortized cost basis, then an OTTI has 

occurred. However, even if the Banc
orp does not intend to sell the debt security and will not likely be required to sell the debt security 
before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, the Bancorp must 

evaluate expected cash flows to be received and determine if a credit 
loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, the credit component 
of the impairment is recognized 
within noninterest income and the 
non-credit component is recognized through other comprehensive 

income. For equity securities, th
e Bancorp™s management evaluates 
the securities in an unrealized lo
ss position in the available-for-sale 
portfolio for OTTI on the basis of the duration of the decline in 

value of the security and severity of that decline as well as the 

Bancorp™s intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of 
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market 
value. If it is determined that th
e impairment on an equity security is 
other than temporary, an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the 
security and its fair value is 
recognized within noninterest income.  
 Portfolio Loans and Leases Basis of Accounting 
Portfolio loans and leases are generally reported at the principal 

amount outstanding, net of unearned income, deferred loan fees 

and costs, and any direct prin
cipal charge-offs. Direct loan 
origination fees and costs are deferred and the net amount is 
amortized over the estimated life of the related loans as a yield 

adjustment. Interest income is recognized based on the principal 
balance outstanding computed using the effective interest method.  
Purchased loans are evaluated for evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition and recorded at their initial fair value. 

For loans acquired with no evidence of credit deterioration, the fair 

value discount or premium is amortized over the contractual life of 

the loan as an adjustment to yiel
d. For loans acquired with evidence 
of credit deterioration, the Bancorp determines at the acquisition 

date the excess of the loan™s cont
ractually required payments over all 
cash flows expected to be collected 
as an amount that should not be accreted into interest income (nonaccretable difference). The 
remaining amount representing the 
difference in the expected cash flows of acquired loans and the 
initial investment in the acquired 
loans is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the 

loan or pool of loans (accretable yi
eld). Subsequent to the purchase 
date, increases in expected cash flows over those expected at the 
purchase date are recognized prospectively as interest income over 
the remaining life of the loan. The present value of any decreases in 
expected cash flows after the pu
rchase date is recognized by 
recording an ALLL or a direct charge-off. Subsequent to the 

purchase date, the methods utilized to estimate the required ALLL 
are similar to originated loans. Loans carried at fair value, mortgage 

loans held for sale and loans unde
r revolving credit agreements are 
excluded from the scope of this guidance on loans acquired with 

deteriorated credit quality.  
The Bancorp™s lease portfolio consists of both direct financing 
and leveraged leases. Direct financing leases are carried at the 
aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the 

leased property, less unearned income. Interest income on direct 

financing leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a 

constant periodic rate of retu
rn on the outstanding investment. 
Leveraged leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments (less 

nonrecourse debt payments) plus estimated residual value of the 
leased property, less unearned income. Interest income on leveraged 
leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a constant 

rate of return on the outstanding investment in the lease, net of the 

related deferred income tax liability,
 in the years in which the net investment is positive.  Nonaccrual Loans 

When a loan is placed on nonaccrual st
atus, the accrual of interest is 
discontinued and all previously a
ccrued and unpaid interest is 
charged against income. Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual 
status when there is a clear indication that the borrower™s cash flow 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
82     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due. Such 
loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when the principal or 

interest is past due ninety days or more, unless the loan is both well 

secured and in the process of collection. The Bancorp classifies 
residential mortgage loans that have principal and interest payments 
that have become past due 150 days and home equity loans with 
principal and interest payments that have become past due 180 days 

as nonaccrual unless the loan is both well secured and in the process 

of collection. Automobile and othe
r consumer loans and leases that have been modified in a TDR and 
subsequently become past due 90 
days are placed on nonaccrual status
. Credit card loans that have 
been modified in a TDR are cla
ssified as nonaccrual unless such 
loans have sustained repayment performance of six months or 
greater and are reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with 

the restructured terms. Well secured loans are collateralized by 

perfected security interests in real and/or personal property for 

which the Bancorp estimates proceeds from sale would be sufficient 

to recover the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance of 
the loan and pay all costs to se
ll the collateral. The Bancorp 
considers a loan in the process of collection if collection efforts or 
legal action is proceeding and the Bancorp expects to collect funds 
sufficient to bring the loan current or recover the entire outstanding 

principal and accrued interest balance. 
Nonaccrual commercial loans, other than loans modified in a 
TDR and nonaccrual credit card loan
s, are generally accounted for 
on the cost recovery method. The Bancorp believes the cost 

recovery method is appropriate for nonaccrual commercial loans 
and nonaccrual credit card loans because the assessment of 
collectability of the remaining reco
rded investment of these loans 
involves a high degree of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the 
nature or absence of underlying collateral. Under the cost recovery 
method, any payments received are applied to reduce principal. 
Once the entire recorded investment is collected, additional 

payments received are treated as recoveries of amounts previously 

charged-off until recovered in full, and any subsequent payments are 

treated as interest income. Nonaccrual residential mortgage loans 
and other nonaccrual consumer loans are generally accounted for on 
the cash basis method. The Bancorp believes the cash basis method 

is appropriate for nonaccrual residential mortgage and other 

nonaccrual consumer loans because such loans have generally been 

written down to estimated collater
al values and the collectability of 
the remaining investment involves only an assessment of the fair 
value of the underlying collateral, which can be measured more 

objectively with a lesser degree of uncertainty than assessments of 
typical commercial loan collateral. Under the cash basis method, 
interest income is recognized upon cash receipt to the extent to 

which it would have been accrued 
on the loan's remaining balance at 
the contractual rate. Nonaccrual lo
ans may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent intere
st and principal payments become 
current in accordance with the loan
 agreement or when the loan is 
both well-secured and in the process of collection.  
Commercial loans on nonaccrual status, as well as criticized 
commercial loans with aggregate borrower relationships exceeding 

$1 million are subject to an individu
al review to identify charge-offs. 
The Bancorp does not have an established delinquency threshold 
for partially or fully charging off commercial loans. Residential 

mortgage, home equity and credit ca
rd loans that have principal and 
interest payments that have become past due 180 days are charged 

off to the ALLL, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the 
process of collection. Automobile and other consumer loans and 
leases that have principal and in
terest payments that have become 
past due 120 days are charged off 
to the ALLL, unless such loans are both well-secured and in the process of collection. 
 Restructured Loans A loan is accounted for as a TDR if the Bancorp, for economic or 

legal reasons related to the borrower™s financial difficulties, grants a 
concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. A 

TDR typically involves a modificati
on of terms such as a reduction 
of the stated interest rate or face amount of the loan, a reduction of 

accrued interest, or an extension of
 the maturity date(s) at a stated 
interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with 
similar risk. The Bancorp measures the impairment loss of a TDR 

based on the difference between the original loan™s carrying amount 

and the present value of expected 
future cash flows discounted at 
the original, effective yield of the loan. Residential mortgage loans, 

home equity loans, automobile 
loans and other consumer loans modified as part of a TDR are maintained on accrual status, 

provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and of 
performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, 
well-documented credit evaluation.
 TDRs of commercial loans and 
credit cards remain on nonaccrual 
status until a six-month payment 
history is sustained. During the nonaccrual period, TDRs of commercial loans are accounted for using the cash basis method for 

income recognition, provided that full repayment of principal under 
the modified terms of the loan is reasonably assured.   

 Impaired Loans 
A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current 

information and events, it is probable that the Bancorp will be 

unable to collect all amounts due (including both principal and 

interest) according to the contract
ual terms of the loan agreement. For loans modified in a TDR, th
e contractual terms of the loan agreement refer to the terms specified in the original loan 

agreement. A loan restructured in a TDR is no longer considered 
impaired in years after the restructuring if the restructuring 
agreement specifies a rate equal to
 or greater than the rate the 
Bancorp was willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a 

new loan with comparable risk an
d the loan is not impaired based on the terms specified by the restructuring agreement. Refer to the 

ALLL section for discussion rega
rding the Bancorp™s methodology 
for identifying impaired loans and determination of the need for a 

loss accrual.  Loans Held for Sale 
Loans held for sale represent conforming fixed rate residential 

mortgage loans originated or acquired with the intent to sell in the 

secondary market and commercial loans and other loans that 
management has an active plan to 
sell. Loans held for sale may be 
carried at the lower of cost or fair value, or carried at fair value 

where the Bancorp has elected the fair value option of accounting 

under U.S. GAAP. The Bancorp has elected to measure residential 
mortgage loans originated as held for sale under the fair value option. For loans in which the Bancorp has not elected the fair 

value option, the lower of cost or fair value is determined at the 

individual loan level. 
The fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale is 
estimated based upon mortgage-backe
d securities prices and spreads 
to those prices or, for certain ARM loans, discounted cash flow 

models that may incorporate the an
ticipated portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-backed securities with similar collateral, and 

market conditions. The anticipated portfolio composition includes 
the effects of interest rate spreads and discount rates due to loan 

characteristics such as the state in which the loan was originated, the 

loan amount and the ARM margin. These fair value marks are 
recorded as a component of noninterest income in mortgage 
banking net revenue. The Bancorp generally has commitments to 
sell residential mortgage loans held for sale in the secondary market. 

Gains or losses on sales are recognized in mortgage banking net 

revenue upon delivery. 
Management™s intent to sell residential mortgage loans 
classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors 

as changes in the overall liquidity in markets or changes in 
characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. Consequently, NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
     Fifth Third Bancorp     83 
 these loans may be reclassified to
 loans held for investment and, 
thereafter, reported within the Bancorp™s residential mortgages class 
of portfolio loans and leases. In such cases, the residential mortgage 
loans will continue to be measured at fair value, which is based on 
mortgage-backed securities prices 
and a credit component that is 
based on internally developed loss rate models.  
Loans held for sale are placed
 on nonaccrual status consistent 
with the Bancorp™s nonaccrual policy 
for portfolio loans and leases.  
 Other Real Estate Owned 
OREO, which is included in other assets, represents property 
acquired through foreclosure or ot
her proceedings and is carried at 
the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. All OREO property 

is periodically evaluated and decreases in carrying value are 

recognized as reductions in other noninterest income in the 

Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 ALLL 
The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The 

Bancorp™s portfolio segments include commercial, residential 

mortgage, and consumer. The Banc
orp further disaggregates its 
portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and 

assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. Classes 
within the commercial portfolio segment include commercial and 
industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial 

mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction, and 
commercial leasing. The residential mortgage portfolio segment is 
also considered a class. Classes within the consumer segment 

include home equity, automobile, cr
edit card, and other consumer 
loans and leases. For an analysis of the Bancorp™s ALLL by 

portfolio segment and credit quality 
information by class, see Note 
6.  The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb probable loan and 
lease losses inherent in its portfolio segments. The ALLL is 

maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is 

based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the 

collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. 

Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. 

Provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the Bancorp™s 
review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, 
in management™s judgment, deserve consideration under existing 
economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. In 

determining the appropriate level of the ALLL, the Bancorp 

estimates losses using a range derived from ﬁbaseﬂ and 

ﬁconservativeﬂ estimates. The Bancorp™s strategy for credit risk 
management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits 

significantly below legal lending limits and conservative 
underwriting, documentation and coll
ections standards. The strategy also emphasizes diversification 
on a geographic, industry and 
customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly 
management reviews of large credit exposures and loans 
experiencing deterioration of credit quality.  
The Bancorp™s methodology for determining the ALLL is 
based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific 

allocation on loans modified in a TDR and impaired commercial 
credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. 
Allowances on individual commercial loans, TDRs and historical 

loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on 

changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual 

collection and charge-off experience. An unallocated allowance is 
maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and 

measuring losses when evaluating allowances for individual loans or 

pools of loans.  
Larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower 
relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or 
observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been 

modified in a TDR, are subject to
 individual review for impairment. 
The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality 

of any guarantees, the guaranto
r™s liquidity and willingness to 
cooperate, the loan structure, and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. Other factors may include 
the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and 
financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the 

borrower, and the Bancorp™s evaluation of the borrower™s 

management. When individual lo
ans are impaired, allowances are 
determined based on management™s estimate of the borrower™s 

ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other 

sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options 

available to the Bancorp. Allo
wances for impaired loans are 
measured based on the present value 
of expected future cash flows 
discounted at the loan™s effective interest rate, fair value of the 

underlying collateral or readily obs
ervable secondary market values. 
The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and 

interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.   
Historical credit loss rates are 
applied to commercial loans that 
are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established 
threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance 
allocations. The loss rates are derived from a migration analysis, 
which tracks the historical net charge-off experience sustained on 

loans according to their internal risk grade. The risk grading system 

utilized for allowance analysis purpos
es encompasses ten categories.  
Homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and 
consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded. 

Rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring 
are used to assess credit risks, and allowances are established based 
on the expected net charge-offs. 
Loss rates are based on the trailing twelve month net charge-off history by loan category. Historical loss 
rates may be adjusted for certain pr
escriptive and qualitative factors 
that, in management™s judgment, are necessary to reflect losses 

inherent in the portfolio. Factors that management considers in the 

analysis include the effects of the national and local economies; 

trends in the nature and volume 
of delinquencies, charge-offs and 
nonaccrual loans; changes in loan mix; credit score migration 
comparisons; asset quality trends; risk management and loan 
administration; changes in the internal lending policies and credit 

standards; collection practices; and examination results from bank 

regulatory agencies and the Bancorp™s internal credit reviewers.  
The Bancorp™s primary market areas for lending are the 
Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the Unites States. When 

evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to 

these regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated 
effect changing economic conditions have on the Bancorp™s 
customers.  In the current year, the Bancor
p has not substantively changed 
any material aspect to its overall approach to determining its ALLL 

for any of its portfolio segments. There have been no material 

changes in criteria or estimation techniques as compared to prior 

periods that impacted the determination of the current period 

ALLL for any of the Bancorp™s portfolio segments.  
 Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 
The reserve for unfunded commitmen
ts is maintained at a level 
believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated 

probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included 

in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 
determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an 
evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment 

of historical commitment utilization 
experience, credit risk grading 
and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. This 

process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are 

analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorp™s 

ALLL, as discussed above. Net adjustments to the reserve for 

unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense 
in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
84     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 Loan Sales and Securitizations 
When the Bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or 
individual loan sales in accordance wi
th its investment policies, it is 
required to assess whether the entity holding the sold or securitized 

loans is a VIE and whether the Ba
ncorp is the primary beneficiary 
and therefore consolidator of that VIE. If the Bancorp holds the 

power to direct activities most significant to the economic 
performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or 
right to receive benefits that coul
d potentially be significant to the 
VIE, then the Bancorp will generally be deemed the primary 

beneficiary of the VIE. When the Bancorp previously sold loans 

into isolated trusts or conduits, it obtained one or more 

subordinated tranches or other residual interests in these trusts or 

conduits, as well as the servicing 
rights to the underlying loans. 
Effective with the adoption of amended VIE consolidation 
guidance on January 1, 2010, the Bancorp was required to 
consolidate these VIEs, and accordingly, the underlying loans and other assets and liabilities of these VIEs are included in the 

Bancorp™s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2011 

and 2010.  Prior to the January 1, 2010 adoption of the VIE consolidation 
guidance referenced above, gains or losses recognized on the sale or 

securitization of such loans were reported as a component of 
noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and 
were based on the previous carrying amount of the loans sold or 

securitized, as well as the fair valu
e of the servicing rights and other 
interests obtained by the Bancorp at the date of sale or 

securitization. Adjustments to the fair value of these other interests prior to January 1, 2010 were included in accumulated other 

comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets or in 

noninterest income in the Consolidat
ed Statements of Income if the 
fair value had declined below the carrying amount and such decline 

was determined to be other-than-temporary.   
Servicing rights resulting from residential mortgage and 
commercial loan sales are initially recorded at fair value and 

subsequently amortized in proportion to and over the period of 

estimated net servicing revenues and are reported as a component 

of mortgage banking net revenue and corporate banking revenue, 

respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Servicing 
rights are assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, 
with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation 

allowance and permanent impairmen
t recognized through a write-
off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance. Key 

economic assumptions used in measuring any potential impairment 

of the servicing rights include the prepayment speeds of the 

underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the discount rate, the 

weighted-average coupon and the we
ighted-average default rate, as 
applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the 

servicing rights resides in the 
potential volatility in the economic 
assumptions used, particularly th
e prepayment speeds. The Bancorp 
monitors risk and adjusts its valuation allowance as necessary to 

adequately reserve for impairment in the servicing portfolio. For 

purposes of measuring impairment,
 the mortgage servicing rights are stratified into classes based on the financial asset type (fixed-rate 

vs. adjustable-rate) and interest ra
tes. Fees received for servicing 
loans owned by investors are based on a percentage of the 

outstanding monthly principal 
balance of such loans and are 

included in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of 

Income as loan payments are received. Costs of servicing loans are 

charged to expense as incurred.  
 Bank Premises and Equipment 
Bank premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, 

are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on 

estimated useful lives of the assets for book purposes, while 

accelerated depreciation is used for income tax purposes. 
Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the 

straight-line method over the lives 
of the related leases or useful 
lives of the related assets, whichever is shorter. The Bancorp tests 

its long-lived assets for impairment through both a probability-
weighted and primary-asset approach whenever events or changes in 
circumstances dictate. Maintenance, repairs and minor 

improvements are charged to noninterest expense in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income as incurred. 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Bancorp accounts for its derivatives as either assets or liabilities 
measured at fair value through adjustments to accumulated other 

comprehensive income and/or current earnings, as appropriate. On 

the date the Bancorp enters into a derivative contract, the Bancorp 

designates the derivative instrument as
 either a fair value hedge, cash 
flow hedge or as a free-standing derivative instrument. For a fair 

value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument 

and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability or of an 
unrecognized firm commitment attrib
utable to the hedged risk are 
recorded in current period net income. For a cash flow hedge, 
changes in the fair value of the de
rivative instrument, to the extent 
that it is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive 
income and subsequently reclassified to net income in the same 

period(s) that the hedged transaction impacts net income. For free-

standing derivative instruments, ch
anges in fair values are reported in current period net income.  
Prior to entering into a hedge transaction, the Bancorp 
formally documents the relationship between hedging instruments 

and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and 

strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process 

includes linking all derivative instru
ments that are designated as fair 
value or cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the 

balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions, along with a 

formal assessment at both inception of the hedge and on an 
ongoing basis as to the effectivene
ss of the derivative instrument in 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective 

as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued and the adjustment to 

fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded in net income.  
 Income Taxes 
The Bancorp estimates income tax expense based on amounts 

expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which the 
Bancorp conducts business. On 
a quarterly basis, management 
assesses the reasonableness of its e
ffective tax rate based upon its 
current estimate of the amount and components of net income, tax 

credits and the applicable statutor
y tax rates expected for the full 
year. The estimated income tax expense is recorded in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using 
the balance sheet method and are reported in other assets and 
accrued taxes, interest and ex
penses, respectively, in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under this method, the net deferred 

tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences 

between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and reflects 

enacted changes in tax rates and laws. Deferred tax assets are 
recognized to the extent they ex
ist and are subject to a valuation 
allowance based on management™s judgment that realization is 
more-likely-than-not. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis 

and includes an evaluation of all positive and negative evidence to 

determine whether realization is more-likely-than-not. 
Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to 
taxing jurisdictions and are reported in accrued taxes, interest and 

expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp 
evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax 
treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering 
statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information and 

maintains tax accruals consistent wi
th its evaluation of these relative 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
     Fifth Third Bancorp     85 
 risks and merits. Changes to the 
estimate of accrued taxes occur 
periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, 
the status of examinations being conducted by taxing authorities 

and changes to statutory, judic
ial and regulatory guidance that 
impact the relative risks of tax po
sitions. These changes, when they 
occur, can affect deferred taxes an
d accrued taxes as well as the 
current period™s income tax expense and can be significant to the 

operating results of the Bancorp. For additional information on 

income taxes, see Note 20. 
 Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income 

available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number 

of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Earnings 
per diluted share is computed by dividing adjusted net income 

available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number 

of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents 

outstanding during the period. Dilutive common stock equivalents 
represent the assumed conversion of
 dilutive convertible preferred 
stock and the exercise of dilutive 
stock-based awards and warrants.  
The Bancorp calculates earnings per share pursuant to the two-
class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation 
formula that determines earnings
 per share separately for common 
stock and participating securities according to dividends declared 

and participation rights in undist
ributed earnings. For purposes of 
calculating earnings per share under the two-class method, restricted 
shares that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are considered participating securities until vested. While the dividends declared per 

share on such restricted shares ar
e the same as dividends declared 
per common share outstanding, the dividends recognized on such 

restricted shares may be less because dividends paid on restricted 

shares that are expected to be forfeited are reclassified to 

compensation expense during the 
period when forfeiture is 
expected.   Goodwill 
Business combinations entered into 
by the Bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be 

tested for impairment at the Bancorp™s reporting unit level on an 

annual basis, which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more 
frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be 
impairment. The Bancorp has determined that its segments qualify 
as reporting units under U.S. GAAP. Impairment exists when a 
reporting unit™s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair 

value, which is determined through a two-step impairment test. The 
first step (Step 1) compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its 

carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the 
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step (Step 2) of the 
goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the impairment 
loss amount, if any. 
The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be 
received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between 

market participants at the measurement date. Since none of the 

Bancorp™s reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting 

unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the 

Bancorp™s stock price. To determine the fair value of a reporting 
unit, the Bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the 
reporting unit™s forecasted cash 
flows (including a terminal value 
approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the 

forecast) and the reporting unit™s estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Additionally, the 
Bancorp determines its market 
capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the 

Bancorp™s stock during the month including the measurement date, 

incorporating an additional cont
rol premium, and compares this 
market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of 
the Bancorp™s reporting units in order to corroborate the results of 

the income approach.  
When required to perform Step 2, the Bancorp compares the 
implied fair value of a reporting unit™s goodwill with the carrying 

amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied 

fair value, an impairment loss e
qual to that excess amount is 
recognized. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the 
carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed even if the 
fair value of the reporting unit recovers. During Step 2, the Bancorp determines the implied fair value of 
goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the 

reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including 
any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been 
acquired in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of 

the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and 
liabilities is the implied fair valu
e of goodwill. This assignment 
process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for 
impairment. The Bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of 

recognized assets or liabilities (oth
er than goodwill, if appropriate), 

nor recognize previously unrecogn
ized intangible assets in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of this assignment 

process. Refer to Note 9 for further information regarding the 

Bancorp™s goodwill. 
  Fair Value Measurements The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair 
value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the 
price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction be
tween market participants at the 
measurement date. Valuation techniques the Bancorp uses to 

measure fair value include the ma
rket approach, income approach 
and cost approach. The market appr
oach uses prices or relevant information generated by market tr
ansactions involving identical or 

comparable assets or liabilities. 
The income approach involves 
discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based 
on current market expectations about those future amounts. The 

cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be 

required to replace the service capacity of the asset. 
U.S. GAAP establishes a fair v
alue hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into 

three broad levels. The fair value hi
erarchy gives the highest priority 
to quoted prices in active market
s for identical assets or liabilities 
(Level 1) and the lowest priority 
to unobservable inputs (Level 3). 
An instrument™s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is 
based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the 

instrument™s fair value measurement. 
The three levels within the fair 
value hierarchy are described as follows:    
 Level 1
 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities that the Bancorp has the ability 

to access at the measurement date. 

 
Level 2
 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within 

Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 

directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: quoted prices 
for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted 

prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 

that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are 

observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are 

derived principally from or corroborated by observable 

market data by correlation or other means. 

 
Level 3
 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the 

measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect the 

Bancorp™s own assumptions
 about what market participants would use to pric
e the asset or liability. The 
inputs are developed based on the best information 

available in the circumstances, which might include the 

Bancorp™s own financial data such as internally developed 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
86     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies, 
as well as instruments for which the fair value 

determination requires significant management judgment. 

 The Bancorp's fair value measur
ements involve various valuation 
techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, 

when available. Valuation techniques and parameters used for 

measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the 

Bancorp on a quarterly basis. Addi
tionally, the Bancorp monitors 

the fair values of significant asse
ts and liabilities using a variety of 
methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception
 reports based on certain analytical 
criteria, comparison to previous 
trades and overall review and asse
ssments for reasonableness. See 
Note 27 for further information on fair value measurements.  
 Stock-Based Compensation  
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Bancorp recognizes 

compensation expense for the grant-
date fair value of stock-based 
awards that are expected to vest over the requisite service period. 

Awards with a graded vesting are expensed on a straight-line basis. 

Awards to employees that meet eligible retirement status are expensed immediately. As compensation expense is recognized, a 

deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of future 

tax deduction from exercise or rele
ase of restrictions. At the time 
awards are exercised, cancelled, expire, or restrictions are released, 

the Bancorp may be required to r
ecognize an adjustment to income 
tax expense for the difference betw
een the previously estimated tax 
deduction and the actual tax deduction realized. For further 

information on the Bancorp™s stock-based compensation plans, see 

Note 24.  Other 
Securities and other property held by Fifth Third Investment 
Advisors, a division of the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary, in a 
fiduciary or agency capacity are not
 included in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets because such items are not assets of the subsidiaries. 

Investment advisory revenue in the Consolidated Statements of 

Income is recognized on the accrual basis. Investment advisory 

service revenues are recognized monthly based on a fee charged per 
transaction processed and/or a fee charged on the market value of 
average account balances associated with individual contracts.  
The Bancorp recognizes revenue from its card and processing 
services on an accrual basis as such services are performed, 
recording revenues net of certain costs (primarily interchange fees 

charged by credit card associations) not controlled by the Bancorp.  
The Bancorp purchases life insurance policies on the lives of 
certain directors, officers and employees and is the owner and 

beneficiary of the policies. The Ba
ncorp invests in these policies, 
known as BOLI, to provide an efficient form of funding for long-

term retirement and other employee benefits costs. The Bancorp 

records these BOLI policies within other assets in the Consolidated 

Balance Sheets at each policy™s respect
ive cash surrender value, with 
changes recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated 

Statements of Income. 
Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles, 
customer lists, non-competition agreements and cardholder 
relationships. Other intangibles are amortized on either a straight-
line or an accelerated basis over their useful lives. The Bancorp 
reviews other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or 

changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be 

recoverable. Securities sold under repurchase agreements are accounted for 
as collateralized financing transacti
ons and included in other short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amounts 
which the securities were sold plus accrued interest. 
   
 Acquisitions of treasury stock ar
e carried at cost. Reissuance of 
shares in treasury for acquisitions
, exercises of stock-based awards 
or other corporate purposes is recorded based on the specific 

identification method.  
Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred. 
 Accounting and Reporting Developments 
Disclosures about the Credit Qualit
y of Financing Receivables and the 
Allowance for Credit Losses 

In July 2010, the FASB issued guidance that requires the Bancorp to disclose a greater level of disaggregated information about the credit 

quality of its loans and leases 
and the ALLL. The new guidance 
defines two levels of disaggregation Œ portfolio segment and class. A 

portfolio segment is defined as the level at which the Bancorp 
develops and documents a systematic method for determining its 

ALLL. Classes generally represent a further disaggregation of a 
portfolio segment based on cert
ain risk characteristics. The 
disclosures relating to information as of the end of a reporting 
period were effective for interim and annual reporting periods 

ending on or after December 15, 2010 and these disclosure 

requirements were adopted by the Bancorp as of December 31, 
2010. The disclosures regarding activity that occurs during a 

reporting period were effective for interim and annual reporting 

periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010 and these 
disclosure requirements were adopted by the Bancorp as of January 
1, 2011. These disclosures are included in Note 6. 

 
When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwi
ll Impairment Test for Reporting Units 
with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts 

In December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance to address 
questions about entities with reporti
ng units with zero or negative 
carrying amounts. For those reporting units, the amended guidance 
requires the entity to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test 
if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In 

determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill 

impairment exists, an entity should
 consider whether there are any 
adverse qualitative factors indicati
ng that an impairment may exist. 
The Bancorp does not currently have any reporting units with zero 

or negative carrying amounts, and therefore the adoption of this 

guidance on January 1, 2011 did not have a material impact on the 
Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations 

In December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance to address 
the diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma 

revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business 

combinations. The amended guidance clarifies that for business 

combination(s) that occur during the year, the Bancorp is required 
to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though 
the business combination(s) occurred as of the beginning of the 

comparable prior annual reporting period. The amended guidance is 

effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is 

on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period 

beginning on or after December 15, 2010 and is effective for 

business combinations consummated by the Bancorp on or after 

January 1, 2011. The Bancorp has not consummated a business 
combination since such guidance became effective. 
 
A Creditor™s Determination of Whether 
a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt 
Restructuring 

In April 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance clarifying 

whether a creditor has granted a c
oncession, and whether a debtor is 
experiencing financial difficulties, for purposes of determining 

whether a restructuring constitutes a TDR. The amended guidance 
also requires the Bancorp to disclose new information about TDR™s, 
including qualitative and quantitative information by portfolio 

segment and class. The amended guidance was effective for the first 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
     Fifth Third Bancorp     87 
 interim or annual reporting period beginning on or after June 15, 
2011, and was adopted by the Bancorp as of July 1, 2011. The 

amended guidance for identifying TDR™s has been applied 

retrospectively to January 1, 2011 and did not have a material impact 
on the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements. The 
disclosures required under the amended guidance are included in 

Note 6. 
 
Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements 

In April 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance clarifying when 

the Bancorp can recognize a sale upon the transfer of financial 

assets subject to a repurchase agreement. That determination is 
based, in part, on whether the Bancorp has maintained effective 
control over the transferred financial assets. Under the amended 

guidance, the FASB concluded that the assessment of effective 

control should focus on a transf
eror™s contractual rights and 
obligations with respect to tran
sferred financial assets, not on whether the transferor has the practical ability to perform in 

accordance with those rights or obligations. The amended guidance 

is effective for transactions that occur in interim and annual periods 
beginning on or after December 15, 2011. The Bancorp accounts 
for all of its existing repurchase agreements as secured borrowings. 
Therefore, this amended guidance is
 not expected to have a material 
impact on the Bancorp's accounting for repurchase agreements 

upon adoption on January 1, 2012.  

 
Amendments to Achieve Common Fair
 Value Measurement and Disclosure 

Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs 
In May 2011, the FASB issued amen
ded guidance that will result in 
common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Under the amended guidance, the 

Bancorp will be required to expand
 its disclosure for fair value 
instruments categorized within Level 
3 of the fair value hierarchy to 

include (1) the valuation processes used by the Bancorp; and (2) a 
narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value measurement 
to changes in unobservable inputs for recurring fair value 
measurements and the interrelationships between those 
unobservable inputs, if any. The Bancorp will also be required to 
disclose the categorization by level of the fair value hierarchy for 

items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial 
position but for which the fair value is required to be disclosed (e.g. 

portfolio loans). The amended guidance is to be applied 

prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods 

beginning after December 15, 2011. 
 Presentation of Comprehensive Income 

In June 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance on the 

presentation requirements for comprehensive income. The amended 

guidance requires the Bancorp to present total comprehensive 

income, the components of net income and the components of 

other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements, 
either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or 
in two separate but consecutive statements. The amended guidance 
does not change the items that must be reported in other 
comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive 

income must be reclassified to net income. This amended guidance 

will be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and 

interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 

2011. 
 Testing Goodwill for Impairment In September 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance on testing 

goodwill for impairment. The amended guidance simplifies how the 

Bancorp is required to test goodwill for impairment and permits the 

Bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is 

more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than 
its carrying amount. If, after asse
ssing the totality of events or 
circumstances, the Bancorp determines it is not more likely than not 

that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, 

then performing the two-step impairment test would be 

unnecessary. However, if the Bancorp concludes otherwise, it would 
then be required to perform Step 
1 of the goodwill impairment test, 
and continue to Step 2, if necessary. The amended guidance is 
effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests 

performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. 

 
Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities  

In December 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance related to 

disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities. The amended 
guidance requires the Bancorp to disclose both gross information 
and net information about financial instruments, including 

derivatives, and transactions eligib
le for offset in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets as well as financial instruments and transactions 

subject to agreements similar to a master netting arrangement. The 

amended guidance will be applied retrospectively and is effective for 

fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or 

after January 1, 2013.

The FRB, under Regulation D, requires that banks hold cash in 
reserve against deposit liabilities, known as the reserve requirement. 

The amount of the reserve requirement is calculated based on net 

transaction account deposits as defined by the FRB and may be 

satisfied with vault cash. When va
ult cash is not sufficient to meet the reserve requirement, the remaining amount must be satisfied 
with funds held at the FRB. At December 31, 2011, the Bancorp™s 
banking subsidiary reserve requirement was $1.1 billion. Vault cash 

was not sufficient to meet the total reserve requirement; therefore, 

the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary satisfied the reserve requirement 

with its $1.5 billion deposit at the FRB.  At December 31, 2010, the 

Bancorp™s banking subsidiary reserve requirement of $575 million 

was fully satisfied with vault cash. 
The dividends paid by the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary are 
subject to regulations and limitations
 prescribed by state and federal 
supervisory agencies. The Bancorp™s banking subsidiary paid the 
Bancorp™s nonbank subsidiary holding company $2.0 billion and 

$1.4 billion in dividends during the years ended December 31, 2011 

and 2010, respectively. The Bancorp™s nonbank subsidiary holding company paid the Bancorp $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion in dividends 

during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the 
Bancorp™s banking subsidiary, under these provisions, was prohibited from declaring additional 

dividends without obtaining prior approval from supervisory 
agencies.   
In 2008, the Bancorp sold $3.4 billion in Series F senior 
preferred stock and related warrants to the U.S. Treasury under the 

terms of the CPP. The terms included certain restrictions on 

common stock dividends, which required the U.S. Treasury™s 

consent to increase common stock dividends for a period of three 
years from the date of investment unless the preferred shares were 
redeemed in whole or the U.S. Treasury transferred all of the 

preferred shares to a third party. For the Bancorp, approval from 

the U.S. Treasury was required for common stock dividends in 

excess of $0.15 per share of common stock. Also, no dividends 

could be declared or paid on the Bancorp™s common stock unless all 

accrued and unpaid dividends had been paid on the preferred shares 

and certain other outstanding securities. Additionally, the Bancorp™s 
ability to pay dividends on its common stock was limited by its need 

to maintain adequate capital leve
ls, comply with safe and sound 
banking practices and meet regulatory expectations.  
On February 2, 2011, the Bancorp redeemed all 136,320 shares 
of its Series F preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury under the 

CPP totaling $3.4 billion. As such, the Bancorp has no restrictions 
on common stock dividends pursuant to the CPP as of December 
31, 2011. See Note 23 for further information on the redemption of 
the preferred shares. 
In February 2009, the FRB advised bank holding companies 
that safety and soundness considerations required that dividends be 

substantially reduced or eliminated. Subsequently, the FRB indicated 

that increased capital distributions would generally not be 

considered prudent in the absence of a well-developed capital plan 
and a capital position that would r
emain strong even under adverse 
conditions. In November 2010, the FRB issued guidelines to 

provide a common, conservative a
pproach to ensure bank holding 
companies hold adequate capital 
to maintain ready access to 
funding, continue operations and meet their obligations to creditors 

and counterparties, and continue to serve as credit intermediaries, 

even in adverse conditions.  These guidelines required the nineteen 

bank holding companies that participated in the 2009 SCAP to 
participate in the 2011 CCAR.  The 2011 CCAR required the 
submission of a comprehensive capital plan that assumed a 

minimum planning horizon of 24 months under various economic 

scenarios.  The plan required ba
nk holding companies to provide 
dividend, stock redemption and stock repurchase plans as well as 

plans for complying with the proposed revisions to the regulatory 

capital framework approved by the Basel Committee on Banking 

Supervision (Basel III). In March 2011, the FRB announced it had 
completed the 2011 CCAR and for bank holding companies that 

proposed capital distributions in th
eir plan, the FRB either objected to the plan or provided a non objection whereby the FRB concurred 

with the proposed 2011 capital distri
butions.  The Bancorp received 
a non objection to its 2011 CCAR capital plan. 
The FRB provided final rules of the 2012 CCAR on November 22, 2011.  The CCAR requires the nineteen SCAP participating bank 
holding companies to submit a capital plan to the FRB by January 9, 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
     Fifth Third Bancorp     89 
 2012 and the Bancorp complied wi
th this requirement. The 
mandatory elements of the capital plan are an assessment of the 
expected uses and sources of capital over the planning horizon, a 

description of all planned capital ac
tions over the planning horizon, a discussion of any expected changes to the Bancorp™s business plan 

that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy or 

liquidity, a detailed description of the Bancorp™s process for 

assessing capital adequacy and the Bancorp™s capital policy.  
The FRB™s review of the Bancorp™s capital plan will assess the 
comprehensiveness of its capital plan, the reasonableness of the 
assumptions and analysis underlying the capital plan and a review of 

the robustness of the capital adeq
uacy process, the capital policy 
and the Bancorp™s ability to maintain capital above the minimum 

regulatory capital ratio and above a Tier 1 common ratio of five 
percent on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful 
conditions throughout the planning horizon.  Following the FRB™s 

assessment of the capital plan, it 
will object or provide a notice of non-objection to the submitted ca
pital plan by March 15, 2012.   4. SECURITIES

 5. LOANS AND LEASES 
The Bancorp diversifies its loan and lease portfolio by offering a 
variety of loan and lease products with various payment terms and 
rate structures. Lending activities
 are concentrated within those 
states in which the Bancorp has banking centers and are primarily 
located in the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United 

States. The Bancorp™s commercial loan portfolio consists of lending 

to various industry types. Management periodically reviews the 
performance of its loan and lease products to evaluate whether they 

are performing within acceptable interest rate and credit risk levels 
and changes are made to underwriting policies and procedures as 
needed. The Bancorp maintains an allowance to absorb loan and 
lease losses inherent in the portfolio. For further information on credit quality and the ALLL, see Note 6.

 CREDIT RISK PROFILE 
Commercial Portfolio Segment 
For purposes of monitoring the credit quality and risk 
characteristics of its commercial portfolio segment, the Bancorp 
disaggregates the segment into the following classes: commercial 
and industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction and 

commercial leasing.  
To facilitate the monitoring 
of credit quality within the 
commercial portfolio segment, and for purposes of analyzing 
historical loss rates used in the determination of the ALLL for the 

commercial portfolio segment, the 
Bancorp utilizes the following categories of credit grades: pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. The five categories, which are derived from 

standard regulatory rating definitions, are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers and updated periodically thereafter. 

Pass ratings, which are assigned to those borrowers that do not have 

identified potential or well define
d weaknesses and for which there 
is a high likelihood of orderly repayment, are updated periodically 

based on the size and credit characteristics of the borrower. All 
other categories are updated on a quarterly basis during the month 
preceding the end of the calendar quarter.  
The Bancorp assigns a special mention rating to loans and 
leases that have potential weaknesses that deserve management™s 

close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, 

at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment 
prospects for the loan or lease or the Bancorp™s credit position.  
The Bancorp assigns a substandard rating to loans and leases 
that are inadequately protected 
by the current sound worth and 
paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged. 
Substandard loans and leases have well defined weaknesses or 
weaknesses that could jeopardize the orderly repayment of the debt. 

Loans and leases in this grade also
 are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bancorp will sustain some loss if the deficiencies 

noted are not addressed and corrected. 
The Bancorp assigns a doubtful rating to loans and leases that 
have all the attributes of a substandard rating with the added 

characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in 
full, on the basis of currently existi
ng facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonable 
specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and 

strengthen the credit quality of the loan or lease, its classification as 

an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be 

determined. Pending factors may include a proposed merger or 

acquisition, liquidation proceeding, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral or refinancing plans. Loans and leases classified as 
loss are considered uncollectible 
and are charged off in the period in
 which they are determined to be 
uncollectible. Because loans and leas
es in this category are fully 
charged down, they are not included in the following tables.

  Consumer Portfolio Segment 
For purposes of monitoring the credit quality and risk 
characteristics of its consumer portfolio segment, the Bancorp disaggregates the segment into the following classes: home equity, 
automobile loans, credit card, and other consumer loans and leases. 

The Bancorp™s residential mortgage portfolio segment is also a 

separate class.  
The Bancorp considers repayment performance as the best 
indicator of credit quality for residential mortgage and consumer 

loans, which includes both the delinquency status and performing 

versus nonperforming status of th
e loans. The delinquency status 
of all residential mortgage and consumer loans is presented by 

class in the age analysis section be
low while the performing versus 
nonperforming status is presented in the table below. Residential 

mortgage loans that have princip
al and interest payments that have 
become past due 150 days and home 
equity loans with principal 
and interest payments that have become past due 180 days are 
classified as nonperforming unle
ss such loans are both well secured 
and in the process of collection. Automobile and other consumer 

loans and leases that have been modified in a TDR and 
subsequently become past due 90 days are classified as 
nonperforming. Credit card loans that have been modified in a 

TDR are classified as nonperforming unless such loans have a 
sustained repayment performance of six months or greater and are 

reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with the 

restructured terms. Well secured loans are collateralized by 

perfected security interests in real and/or personal property for 
which the Bancorp estimates proceeds from sale would be 
sufficient to recover the outstanding principal and accrued interest 
balance of the loan and pay all 
costs to sell the collateral. The 
Bancorp considers a loan in the process of collection if collection 

efforts or legal action is proceeding and the Bancorp expects to 

collect funds sufficient to bring the loan current or recover the 
entire outstanding principal and accrued interest balance.

 Impaired Loans and Leases 
Larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower 

relationship balances exceeding $1 
million that exhibit probable or 
observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review for 
impairment. The Bancorp also performs an individual review on 
loans that are restructured in a troubled debt restructuring. The 

Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of 

any guarantees, the loan structure, and other factors when 
evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. Other factors 

may include the geography and industry of the borrower, size and 

financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the 

borrower, and the Bancorp™s evaluation of the borrower™s 
management. Smaller-balance homogenous loans that are 
collectively evaluated for impairment are not included in the 

following tables.   The following table summarizes the Bancorp™s impaired loans and leases (by class) that

 Troubled Debt Restructurings  
If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the Bancorp may 

consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan 

to maximize collection of amou
nts due. Within each of the 
Bancorp™s loan classes, TDRs typically involve either a reduction of 

the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the loan™s 
maturity date(s) at a stated rate lower than the current market rate 
for a new loan with similar risk, or in limited circumstances, a 
reduction of the principal balance of the loan or the loan™s accrued 
interest. Upon modification, an imp
airment loss is recognized as an 
increase to the ALLL and is measur
ed as the difference between the 
original loan™s carrying amount and the present value of expected 

future cash flows discounted at th
e original, effective yield of the 
loan. If a portion of the original loan™s principal balance is 

determined to be uncollectible at the time of modification, or if the 

TDR involves a reduction of the prin
cipal balance of the loan or the 
loan™s accrued interest, that amount is charged off to the ALLL. At 
December 31, 2011, the Bancorp had $42 million in line of credit 
commitments and $1 million in letter of credit commitments to lend 

additional funds to borrowers whose terms have been modified in a 

troubled debt restructuring compared to $47 million and $1 million, 
respectively, at December 31, 2010.

The Bancorp considers TDRs that become 90 days or more past 

due under the modified terms as subsequently defaulted.  For 

commercial loans not subject to individual review for impairment, 

the historical loss rates that are applied to such commercial loans for 

purposes of determining the allo
wance include historical losses 
associated with subsequent defaults
 on loans previously modified in 
a TDR.  For consumer loans, th
e Bancorp performs a qualitative 
assessment of the adequacy of the consumer ALLL by comparing 

the consumer ALLL to forecasted consumer losses over the 

projected loss emergence period (the forecasted losses include the 
impact of subsequent defaults of consumer TDRs).  When a 

residential mortgage, home equity, auto or other consumer loan that 

has been modified in a TDR subsequently defaults, the present 

value of expected cash flows used in the measurement of the 

potential impairment loss is generally limited to the expected net 

proceeds from the sale of the lo
an™s underlying collateral and any 
resulting impairment loss is reflected
 as a charge-off or an increase 
in ALLL.  When a credit card loan
 that has been modified in a TDR 
subsequently defaults, the calcu
lation of the impairment loss is 
consistent with the Bancorp™s calculation for other credit card loans 

that have become 90 days or more past due.

 7. LOANS WITH DETERIORATED CREDIT QUALITY ACQUIRED IN A TRANSFER 
The Bancorp has acquired in prior years certain loans for which 
there was evidence of deterioration of credit quality since 
origination and for which it was probable, at acquisition, that all 
contractually required payments woul
d not be collected. During the 
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Bancorp 

recorded provision expense for loans acquired with deteriorated 

credit quality of $7 million, $6 million and $21 million, respectively, 
in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, as of 

December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bancorp maintained an allowance 
for loan and lease losses of $2 million and $3 million, respectively, 
on these loans. The following table reflects the outstanding balance of all contractually required payments and carrying amounts of loans

  The Bancorp completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of 

September 30, 2011 and determined that no impairment existed. In 

Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test, the Bancorp compared the 
fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including 
goodwill. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, the 

Bancorp employed an income-based approach utilizing the 

reporting unit™s forecasted cash 
flows (including a terminal value 
approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the 

forecast) and the reporting unit™s estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. The Bancorp believes that this DCF method, using 
management projections for the respective reporting units and an 
appropriate risk adjusted discount rate, is most reflective of a 
market participant™s view of fair values given current market 
conditions. Under the DCF method, th
e forecasted cash flows were 
developed for each reporting unit by considering several key 

business drivers such as new business initiatives, client retention 
standards, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit 

growth, forward interest rates, historical performance, and industry 

and economic trends, among other considerations.  
The long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal 
value of each reporting unit was estimated at three percent based on 

the Bancorp™s assessment of the minimum expected terminal 

growth rate of each reporting unit, as well as broader economic 

considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation. 

Discount rates were estimated 
based on a Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk 

premium, beta, and in some cases, unsystematic risk and size 
premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The 
discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the 

reporting units were 16.9% fo
r Commercial Banking, 15.9% for 
Branch Banking and 18.7% for Investment Advisors.  
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
102     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 Based on the results of the Step 1 test, the Bancorp determined 
that the fair value of the Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, and 
Investment Advisors segments exceeded their respective carrying 

values, and consequently, no further testing was required.  
The Step 1 analysis prepared for the Bancorp™s segments 
resulted in the fair values of
 the Commercial Banking and Branch Banking segments exceeding their carrying values, including 

goodwill, by 9% and 4% respectively, while the fair value of the 

Investment Advisors segment substantially exceeded its carrying 

value, including goodwill.  
The long-term growth rate required to avoid failing Step 1 for 
the Commercial Banking reporting unit, with all other assumptions 
held constant, was 0.3%. Other key assumptions used in forecasting 

cash flows for the Commercial Banking reporting unit include 

commercial loan portfolio growth as
 well as long-term credit loss 
rates, which are based on long-term historical loss rates and 
management™s expectation of long-term credit quality within the 
portfolio.  The long-term growth rate required to avoid failing Step 1 for 
the Branch Banking reporting unit, with all other assumptions held 
constant, was 1.4%. Other key assumptions used in forecasting cash 

flows for the Branch Banking reporting unit include deposit growth 

assumptions, forecasted spreads ea
rned on the unit™s deposits, and 
the impact of recent and anticipated regulatory changes affecting 
retail banking.  The Bancorp forecasts its deposit growth based on expected 
growth in loan demand as well as
 availability and expected use of 
alternative funding sources over that period. The earnings spread 

assumption on deposits is based on forward LIBOR rates and the 

sensitivity of the Bancorp™s deposit rates to changes in LIBOR. The 

Bancorp considered the impact of recent and anticipated regulatory 

changes that impacted overdraft revenue, debit interchange revenue 
and credit card revenue in 2011 and will continue to evaluate the 
potential impact of these change
s in 2012 and beyond. Changes in these key assumptions and inputs to these key assumptions could 
negatively impact the fair value of the Commercial Banking and 

Branch Banking reporting units in future periods. These changes 

would include unanticipated re
gulatory changes, movement in 
interest rates and economic trends affecting the segments™ 
profitability.  10. INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Intangible assets consist of servicing rights, core deposit intangibles, 
customer lists, non-compete agreements and cardholder 

relationships. Intangible assets, excluding servicing rights, are 
amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis over their 
estimated useful lives and have an 
estimated weighted-average life at 
December 31, 2011 of 3.9 years. The Bancorp reviews intangible 
assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be 
recoverable. For more information on servicing rights, see Note 12.

 11. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
The Bancorp, in the normal course of business, engages in a variety 
of activities that involve VIEs, which are legal entities that lack 
sufficient equity to finance their acti
vities, or the equity investors of 
the entities as a group lack any of 
the characteristics of a controlling 
interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is generally the enterprise 
that has both the power to direct th
e activities most significant to 
the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb 

losses or receive benefits that coul
d potentially be significant to the VIE. For certain investment funds, the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that will absorb a majo
rity of the fund™s expected losses 
or receive a majority of the fund™s expected residual returns. The Bancorp evaluates its interest in cert
ain entities to determine if these 
entities meet the definition of a VIE and whether the Bancorp is the 

primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the 
variable interests it held both at inception and when there is a 

change in circumstances that re
quire a reconsideration. If the 
Bancorp is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it 

must account for the VIE as a consolidated subsidiary. If the 

Bancorp is determined not to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE 

but holds a variable interest in the 
entity, such variable interests are 
accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other 

accounting standards as appropriate.

                  Home Equity and Automobile Loan Securitizations 
The Bancorp previously sold $903 million of home equity lines of 
credit to an isolated trust. Additi
onally, the Bancorp previously sold 
$2.7 billion of automobile loans to 
an isolated trust and conduits in 
three separate transactions. Each of these transactions isolated the 
related loans through the use of a VIE that, under accounting 

guidance effective prior to January 1, 2010, was not consolidated by 

the Bancorp. The VIEs were funded through loans from large 

multi-seller asset-backed commerc
ial paper conduits sponsored by 
third party agents, asset-backed securities issued with varying levels 
of credit subordination and payment 
priority, and residual interests. 
The Bancorp retained residual interests in these entities and, 

therefore, has an obligation to abso
rb losses and a right to receive 
benefits from the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the 

VIEs. In addition, the Bancorp retained servicing rights for the underlying loans and, therefore,
 holds the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the economic 
performance of the VIEs. As a result, the Bancorp determined it is 

the primary beneficiary of these VIEs
 and, effective January 1, 2010, 
these VIEs have been consolidated in the Bancorp™s Consolidated 

Financial Statements. The assets of 
each VIE are restricted to the 
settlement of the long-term debt and other liabilities of the 

respective entity. Third-party holders of this debt do not have 

recourse to the general assets of the Bancorp. 
The economic performance of the VIEs is most significantly 
impacted by the performance of the underlying loans. The principal 

risks to which the entities are exposed include credit risk and 

interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed through credit enhancement 

in the form of reserve accounts, overcollateralization, excess interest 
on the loans, the subordination of 
certain classes of asset-backed 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 securities to other classes, and in the case of the home equity 
transaction, an insurance policy with a third party guaranteeing 

payment of accrued and unpaid interest and principal on the 
securities. Interest rate risk is managed by interest rate swaps between the VIEs and third parties.

CDC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bancorp, was created to 

invest in projects to create affordable housing, revitalize business 
and residential areas, and preserve historic landmarks. CDC 

generally co-invests with other unrelated companies and/or 

individuals and typically makes investments in a separate legal entity 

that owns the property under devel
opment. The entities are usually 
formed as limited partnerships and LLCs, and CDC typically invests 
as a limited partner/investor member in the form of equity 

contributions. The economic performance of the VIEs is driven by 

the performance of their underlying investment projects as well as 

the VIEs™ ability to operate in
 compliance with the rules and 
regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by 

equity investments. Typically, the general partner or managing 

member will be the party that has th
e right to make decisions that 
will most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
entity. The Bancorp serves as the managing member of certain 
LLCs invested in business revitalization projects. The Bancorp has 
provided an indemnification guarantee to the investor member of 

these LLCs related to the qualification of tax credits generated by 

the investor member™s investment. Accordingly, the Bancorp 

concluded that it is the primary 
beneficiary and, therefore, has 
consolidated these VIEs. As a result, the VIEs are presented as 

noncontrolling interests in the Banc
orp™s Consolidated Financial Statements. This presentation includes reporting separately the 

equity attributable to the 
noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of 

Changes in Equity. Additionally, the 
net income attributable to the 
noncontrolling interests is reported separately in the Consolidated 
Statements of Income. The Bancorp™s maximum exposure related to 
the indemnification at December 
31, 2011 and 2010 was $10 million 
and $9 million, respectively, which is based on an amount required 
to meet the investor member™s defined target rate of return.

             CDC Investments 
As noted previously, CDC typically invests in VIEs as a limited 

partner or investor member in the form of equity contributions. The 

Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of 
these VIEs because it lacks the power
 to direct the activities that 
most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
underlying project or the VIEs™ ability to operate in compliance with 

the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax 

credits generated by equity investments. This power is held by the 

general partners/managing members who exercise full and exclusive 

control of the operations of the VIEs. Accordingly, the Bancorp 

accounts for these investments under the equity method of 
accounting.  The Bancorp™s funding requirements are limited to its invested 
capital and any additional unfunded
 commitments for future equity 
contributions. The Bancorp™s maximum exposure to loss as a result 
of its involvement with the VIEs is limited to the carrying amounts 

of the investments, including the unfunded commitments. The 

carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other 

assets in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets, and the liabilities related 
to the unfunded commitments, which are included in other liabilities 

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,
 are included in the previous 
tables for all periods presented. 
The Bancorp has no other liquidity 
arrangements or obligations to purchase assets of the VIEs that 
would expose the Bancorp to a loss. In certain arrangements, the 

general partner/managing member of the VIE has guaranteed a 

level of projected tax credits to be received by the limited 
partners/investor members, thereby minimizing a portion of the 
Bancorp™s risk. 
 
Private Equity Investments 
The Bancorp invests as a limited partner in private equity funds 

which provide the Bancorp an opportunity to obtain higher rates of 

return on invested capital, while also creating cross-selling 

opportunities for the Bancorp™s commercial products. Each of the 
limited partnerships has an unrelated third-party general partner 

responsible for appointing the fund manager. The Bancorp has not 
been appointed fund manager for an
y of these private equity funds. 
The funds finance primarily all of their activities from the partners™ 
capital contributions and investment returns. Under the VIE 

consolidation guidance still applicable to the funds, the Bancorp has 

determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the funds 

because it does not absorb a majority of the funds™ expected losses 

or receive a majority of the fund
s™ expected residual returns. Therefore, the Bancorp accounts fo
r its investments in these limited 
partnerships under the equity method of accounting. 
The Bancorp is exposed to losses arising from negative 
performance of the underlying investments in the private equity 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
     Fifth Third Bancorp     105 
 funds. As a limited partner, the Bancorp™s maximum exposure to 
loss is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments plus 

unfunded commitments. The carrying amounts of these 

investments, which are included in other assets in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets, are included in the above tables. Also, as of 

December 31, 2011 and 2010 the unfunded commitment amounts 

to the funds were $166 million and $193 million, respectively. The 
Bancorp made capital contributions of $48 million and $34 million, 

respectively, to private equity funds during 2011 and 2010.  
 
Money Market Funds 
Under U.S. GAAP, money market funds are generally not 

considered VIEs because they are generally deemed to have 

sufficient equity at risk to finance their activities without additional 
subordinated financial support, and the fund shareholders do not 
lack the characteristics of a controlling interest. However, when a 
situation arises where an inve
stment manager provides credit support to a fund, even when not contractually required to do so, 

the investment manager is deemed under U.S. GAAP to have 

provided an implicit guarantee of the fund™s performance to the 

fund™s shareholders. Such an implicit guarantee would require the 
investment manager and other variable interest holders to 
reconsider the VIE status of the fund, as well as all other similar 
funds where such an implicit guarantee is now deemed to exist.  
In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Bancorp voluntarily provided 
credit support of less than $1 million to a money market fund 

managed by FTAM. Accordingly, the Bancorp was required to 

analyze the money market funds and similar funds managed by 

FTAM under the VIE consolidation guidance still applicable to 

these funds to determine the primary beneficiary of each fund. In 
analyzing these funds, the Bancorp determined that interest rate risk 
and credit risk are the two main risks to which the funds are 

exposed. After analyzing the interest rate risk variability and credit 

risk variability associated with these funds, the Bancorp determined 

that it is not the primary beneficiary of these funds because it does 

not absorb a majority of the funds™ expected losses or receive a 

majority of the funds™ expected 
residual returns. Therefore, the 
Bancorp™s investments in these funds are included as other 
securities in the Bancorp™s 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Loans Provided to VIEs 
The Bancorp has provided funding to certain unconsolidated VIEs 
sponsored by third parties. These VIEs are generally established to 
finance certain consumer and small business loans originated by 

third parties. The entities are primarily funded through the issuance 
of a loan from the Bancorp or syndication through which the 

Bancorp is involved. The sponsor/administrator of the entities is 

responsible for servicing the underlying assets in the VIEs. Because 
the sponsor/administrator, not the Bancorp, holds the servicing 
responsibilities, which include th
e establishment and employment of 
default mitigation policies and procedures, the Bancorp does not 

hold the power to direct the activities most significant to the 
economic performance of the entity and, therefore, is not the 

primary beneficiary. The principal risk to which these entities are exposed is credit 
risk related to the underlying assets. The Bancorp™s maximum 
exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts of the loans and 

unfunded commitments to the VIEs. The Bancorp™s outstanding 

loans to these VIEs, included
 in commercial loans in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets, are incl
uded in the previous tables for 
all periods presented. Also, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the 

Bancorp™s unfunded commitments to these entities were $833 
million and $733 million, respectively. The loans and unfunded 
commitments to these VIEs are included in the Bancorp™s overall 
analysis of the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments, 
respectively. The Bancorp does not provide any implicit or explicit 
liquidity guarantees or principal 
value guarantees to these VIEs. 
 Restructured Loans As part of loan restructuring efforts, the Bancorp received equity 

capital from certain borrowers to facilitate the restructuring of the 
borrower™s debt. These borrowers meet the definition of a VIE 
because the Bancorp was involved 
in their refinancing and because 
their equity capital is insufficien
t to fund ongoing operations. These 
restructurings were intended to provide the VIEs with serviceable 

debt levels while providing the Bancorp an opportunity to maximize 

the recovery of the loans. The VIEs finance their operations from 

earned income, capital contributions, and through restructured debt 

agreements. Assets of the VIEs are used to settle their specific 
obligations, including loan payments due to the Bancorp. The 
Bancorp continues to maintain its relationship with these VIEs as a 

lender and minority shareholder, however, it is not involved in 

management decisions and does not ha
ve sufficient voting rights to 
control the membership of the respective boards. Therefore, the 
Bancorp accounts for its equity investments in these VIEs under the 

equity method or cost method based on its percentage of ownership 

and ability to exercise significant influence. The Bancorp™s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its 
involvement with these VIEs is limited to the equity investments, 
the principal and accrued interest 
on the outstanding loans, and any 
unfunded commitments. Due to the VIEs™ short-term cash deficit 

projections at the restructuring dates, the Bancorp determined that 

the initial fair value of its equity investments in these VIEs was zero. 

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bancorp™s carrying value of 

these equity investments was imma
terial. Additionally, the Bancorp 
had outstanding loans to these VI
Es, included in commercial loans 
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which are included in the above 

tables for all periods presented. The Bancorp™s unfunded loan 

commitments to these VIEs were $2 million and $1 million at 
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The loans and unfunded 

commitments to these VIEs are included in the Bancorp™s overall 

analysis of the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments, 

respectively. The Bancorp does not provide any implicit or explicit 
liquidity guarantees or principal v
alue guarantees to these VIEs.

The Bancorp sold fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage 
loans during 2011, 2010, and 2009. 
In those sales, the Bancorp 
obtained servicing responsibilities and the investors have no 
recourse to the Bancorp™s other asse
ts for failure of debtors to pay 
when due. The Bancorp receives annual servicing fees based on a 

percentage of the outstanding balance. The Bancorp identifies 
classes of servicing assets based on financial asset type and interest 
rates.

to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value 

of the MSR portfolio. This strategy includes the purchase of free-
standing derivatives and various available-for-sale securities. The 

interest income, mark-to-market adjustments and gain or loss from 
sale activities associated with 
these portfolios are expected to 
economically hedge a portion of the change in value of the MSR 

portfolio caused by fluctuating discount rates, earnings rates and 

prepayment speeds.

serviced $57.1 billion and $54.2 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans for other investors. The value of interests that

market interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased 

credit losses), which might magnify or counteract these sensitivities.

 13. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Bancorp maintains an overall risk management strategy that 
incorporates the use of derivative 
instruments to reduce certain risks 
related to interest rate, prepaymen
t and foreign currency volatility. Additionally, the Bancorp holds derivative instruments for the 

benefit of its commercial customers and for other business 

purposes. The Bancorp does not enter into unhedged speculative 

derivative positions. 

 The Bancorp™s interest rate risk management strategy involves 

modifying the repricing characteristics of certain financial 
instruments so that changes in interest rates do not adversely affect 
the Bancorp™s net interest margin and cash flows. Derivative 
instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, 

interest rate caps, forward contracts, options and swaptions. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest payments, such as 

fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on a stated 

notional amount and maturity date
. Interest rate floors protect 
against declining rates, while interest rate caps protect against rising 
interest rates. Forward contracts are contracts in which the buyer 

agrees to purchase, and the seller agrees to make delivery of, a 

specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. 

Options provide the purchaser with 
the right, but not the obligation, 
to purchase or sell a contracted it
em during a specified period at an agreed upon price. Swaptions are 
financial instruments granting the owner the right, but not the obligation, to enter into or cancel a 

swap.  Prepayment volatility arises mostly from changes in fair value 
of the largely fixed-rate MSR portfolio, mortgage loans and 

mortgage-backed securities. The 
Bancorp may enter into various 
free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate 

swaptions, interest rate floors, mortgage options, TBAs and interest 

rate swaps) to economically hedge 
prepayment volatility. Principal-only swaps are total return swaps based on changes in the value of 

the underlying mortgage princip
al-only trust. TBAs are a forward 
purchase agreement for a mortgage-backed securities trade whereby 
the terms of the security are undefined at the time the trade is made.  

 Foreign currency volatility occurs as the Bancorp enters into 

certain loans denominated in foreign currencies. Derivative 

instruments that the Bancorp may use to economically hedge these 

foreign denominated loans include foreign exchange swaps and 
forward contracts. 
 The Bancorp also enters into 
derivative contracts (including 
foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts and interest rate 

contracts) for the benefit of commercial customers and other 

business purposes. The Bancorp may economically hedge significant 

exposures related to these free-standing derivatives by entering into 

offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable 
counterparties with substantiall
y matching terms and currencies. 
Credit risk arises from the possi
ble inability of counterparties to 
meet the terms of their contracts. The Bancorp™s exposure is limited 
to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, 
principal or contract amounts. Credit risk is minimized through 

credit approvals, limits, counterparty collateral and monitoring procedures.  
 The Bancorp™s derivative assets contain certain contracts in 

which the Bancorp requires the counterparties to provide collateral 
in the form of cash and securities 
to offset changes in the fair value 

of the derivatives, including changes in the fair value due to credit 
risk of the counterparty. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the 
balance of collateral held by the Bancorp for derivative assets was 

$1.2 billion and $903 million, respectively. The credit component 
negatively impacting the fair value of derivative assets associated 

with customer accommodation contracts as of December 31, 2011 

and 2010 was $28 million and $41 million, respectively.  

 In measuring the fair value of derivative liabilities, the Bancorp 

considers its own credit risk, taking into consideration collateral 
maintenance requirements of certain derivative counterparties and 

the duration of instruments with counterparties that do not require 
collateral maintenance. When necessary, the Bancorp primarily 

posts collateral in the form of cash and securities to offset changes 
in fair value of the derivatives, including changes in fair value due to 

the Bancorp™s credit risk. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the 

balance of collateral posted by the Ba
ncorp for derivative liabilities 
was $788 million and $680 million, respectively. Certain of the 

Bancorp™s derivative liabilities contain credit-risk related contingent 

features that could result in 
the requirement to post additional collateral upon the occurrence of specified events. As of December 

31, 2011, the fair value of the a
dditional collateral that could be 
required to be posted as a result of the credit-risk related contingent 

features being triggered was not material to the Bancorp™s 

Consolidated Financial Statements.
 The posting of collateral has been determined to remove the need for consideration of credit 

risk. As a result, the Bancorp determined that the impact of the 

Bancorp™s credit risk to the valuation of its derivative liabilities was 
immaterial to the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The Bancorp holds certain derivative instruments that qualify 
for hedge accounting treatment and 
are designated as either fair 
value hedges or cash flow hedges. Derivative instruments that do 

not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, or for which hedge 
accounting is not established, are 
held as free-standing derivatives. 
All customer accommodation derivatives are held as free-standing 

derivatives. 
 The fair value of derivative in
struments is presented on a gross 
basis, even when the derivative 
instruments are subject to master 
netting arrangements. Derivative instruments with a positive fair 
value are reported in other assets in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets while derivative instruments with a negative fair value are 

reported in other liabilities in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash 
collateral payables and receivables associated with the derivative 

instruments are not added to or netted against the fair value 
amounts.

     Fifth Third Bancorp     111 
 Fair Value Hedges 
The Bancorp may enter into interest
 rate swaps to convert its fixed-
rate funding to floating-rate. Deci
sions to convert fixed-rate funding 
to floating are made primarily through consideration of the 
asset/liability mix of the Bancorp, the desired asset/liability 
sensitivity and interest rate levels. As of December 31, 2011 and 

2010 certain interest rate swaps met the criteria required to qualify 

for the shortcut method of accounting. Based on this shortcut 

method of accounting treatment, no ineffectiveness is assumed. For 

interest rate swaps that do not meet the shortcut requirements, an 

assessment of hedge effectiveness using regression analysis was 

performed and such swaps were accounted for using the ﬁlong-
haulﬂ method. The long-haul 
method requires a quarterly 
assessment of hedge effectiveness and measurement of 
ineffectiveness. For interest rate swaps accounted for as a fair value 
hedge using the long-haul method, 
ineffectiveness is the difference 
between the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and 
changes in fair value of the related hedged item attributable to the 
risk being hedged. The ineffectiveness on interest rate swaps 

hedging fixed-rate funding is reported within interest expense in the 

Consolidated Statements of Income.
 The following table reflects the 

change in fair value of interest rate contracts, designated as fair 

value hedges, as well as the change in fair value of the related 

hedged items attributable to the ri
sk being hedged, included in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income:

        Cash Flow Hedges 
The Bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert floating-
rate assets and liabilities to fixed rates or to hedge certain forecasted 

transactions. The assets or liabilities may be grouped in 

circumstances where they share the same risk exposure for which 

the Bancorp desired to hedge. The Bancorp may also enter into 

interest rate caps and floors to limit cash flow variability of floating 

rate assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, all hedges 

designated as cash flow hedges are assessed for effectiveness using 
regression analysis. Ineffectiveness is generally measured as the 
amount by which the cumulative change in the fair value of the 

hedging instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative 
change in the hedged item™s expected cash flows attributable to the 

risk being hedged. Ineffectiveness is reported within other 

noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The 

effective portion of the cumulati
ve gains or losses on cash flow hedges are reported within accumulated other comprehensive 
income and are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive 
income to current period earnings when the forecasted transaction 

affects earnings.  
 Reclassified gains and losses on interest rate contracts related 

to commercial and industrial loans 
are recorded within interest 
income while reclassified gains and losses on interest rate contracts 
related to debt are recorded within interest expense in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2011 and 
2010, $80 million and $67 million, respectively, of deferred gains, 

net of tax, on cash flow hedges were recorded in accumulated other 

comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of 

December 31, 2011, $70 million in net deferred gains, net of tax, 

recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are expected 

to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. 

During 2011, $11 million of losses were reclassified from 
accumulated other comprehensive income into noninterest expense 
as it was determined that the original forecasted transaction was no 

longer probable of occurring by the end of the originally specified 

time period or within the additional period of time as defined by 
U.S. GAAP. During 2010, there were no gains or losses reclassified 

into earnings associated with 
the discontinuance of cash flow 
hedges because it was probable that the original forecasted 

transaction would not occur.  
 The following table presents the net gains (losses) recorded in 
the Consolidated Statements of
 Income and accumulated other

hedges.

  Free-Standing Derivative Instruments Œ Risk Management 
and Other Business Purposes 
As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its 

mortgage banking activity, the Ba
ncorp may enter into various free-
standing derivatives (principal-only 
swaps, interest rate swaptions, 
interest rate floors, mortgage options, TBAs and interest rate swaps) 

to economically hedge changes in fair value of its largely fixed-rate 

MSR portfolio. Principal-only swaps hedge the mortgage-LIBOR 

spread because these swaps appreciate in value as a result of 
tightening spreads. Principal-only swaps also provide prepayment 
protection by increasing in value when prepayment speeds increase, 
as opposed to MSRs that lose value in a faster prepayment 

environment. Receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps and 

swaptions increase in value when interest rates do not increase as 

quickly as expected.  The Bancorp enters into forward contracts and mortgage 
options to economically hedge the change in fair value of certain 
residential mortgage loans held for sale due to changes in interest rates. The Bancorp may also enter into forward swaps to 

economically hedge the change in f
air value of certain commercial mortgage loans held for sale due to 
changes in interest rates. Interest 
rate lock commitments issued on residential mortgage loan 

commitments that will be held for sale are also considered free-
standing derivative instruments an
d the interest rate exposure on these commitments is economically hedged primarily with forward 
contracts. Revaluation gains and losses from free-standing 

derivatives related to mortgage banking activity are recorded as a 

component of mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated 

Statements of Income. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
112     Fifth Third Bancorp 
  Additionally, the Bancorp may enter into free-standing 
derivative instruments (options, sw
aptions and interest rate swaps) 
in order to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash 
flows caused by interest rate and prepayment volatility. The gains 
and losses on these derivative contracts are recorded within other 
noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

 In conjunction with the sale of the processing business in 2009, 

the Bancorp received warrants and issued put options, which are 

accounted for as free-standing deri
vatives. Refer to Note 27 for 
further discussion of significant inputs and assumptions used in the 

valuation of these instruments. 

 In conjunction with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares in 
2009, the Bancorp entered into a to
tal return swap in which the 
Bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent 
changes in the conversion rate of the Class B shares into Class A 
shares. This total return swap is
 accounted for as a free-standing 
derivative. See Note 27 for further discussion of significant inputs 
and assumptions used in the valuation of this instrument.  
 The Bancorp entered into certain
 derivatives (forwards, futures 
and options) related to its foreign exchange business. These 
derivative contracts were not designated against specific assets or 
liabilities or to forecasted transact
ions. Therefore, these instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting. The Bancorp economically 

hedged the exposures related to these derivative contracts by 

entering into offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, 

independent counterparties with substantially similar terms. 

Revaluation gains and losses on these foreign currency derivative 

contracts were recorded within other noninterest income in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gains (losses) recorded 
in the Consolidated Statements of Income relating to free-standing 

derivative instruments used for ri
sk management and other business 
purposes are summarized in the following table:

      Free-Standing Derivative Instruments Œ Customer 
Accommodation 
The majority of the free-standing derivative instruments the 

Bancorp enters into are for the benefit of its commercial customers. 

These derivative contracts are not designated against specific assets 

or liabilities on the Bancorp™s Consolidated Balance Sheets or to 
forecasted transactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge 
accounting. These instruments include foreign exchange derivative 
contracts entered into for the benefit of commercial customers 
involved in international trade to
 hedge their exposure to foreign 
currency fluctuations and commodity contracts to hedge such items 
as natural gas and various other derivative contracts. The Bancorp 

may economically hedge significant exposures related to these 
derivative contracts entered into for the benefit of customers by 
entering into offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, 
independent counterparties with substantially matching terms. The 

Bancorp hedges its interest rate exposure on commercial customer 
transactions by executing offsetting swap agreements with primary 

dealers. Revaluation gains and losses on interest rate, foreign 

exchange, commodity and other commercial customer derivative 

contracts are recorded as a component of corporate banking 

revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  
 The Bancorp previously offered its customers an equity-linked 
certificate of deposit that had a return linked to equity indices. 
Under U.S. GAAP, a certificate of deposit that pays interest based 
on changes on an equity index is a hybrid instrument that requires 

separation into a host contract (the certificate of deposit) and an 

embedded derivative contract (written equity call option). The 

Bancorp entered into offsetting derivative contracts to economically 

hedge the exposure taken through the issuance of equity-linked 
certificates of deposit. Both the embedded derivative and the 
derivative contract entered into by the Bancorp are recorded as free-

standing derivatives and recorded at
 fair value with offsetting gains 
and losses recognized within noninterest income in the 

Consolidated Statements of Income. The Bancorp enters into risk 
participation agreements, under which the Bancorp assumes credit 
exposure relating to certain underlying interest rate derivative 

contracts. The Bancorp only enters into these risk participation 

agreements in instances in which the Bancorp has participated in the 

loan that the underlying interest rate derivative contract was 

designed to hedge. The Bancorp will make payments under these 

agreements if a customer defaults on its obligation to perform under 
the terms of the underlying interest rate derivative contract. As of 
December 31, 2011 and 2010 the total notional amount of the risk 

participation agreements was $808 million and $851 million, 

respectively, and the fair value was a liability of $2 million at 

December 31, 2011 and $1 million at December 31, 2010, which is 
included in interest rate contracts for customers. As of December 

31, 2011, the risk participation agreements had an average life of 2.5 

years.  The Bancorp™s maximum exposure in the risk participation 
agreements is contingent on the fair value of the underlying interest 

rate derivative contracts in an a
sset position at the time of default. 
The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with the underlying 

customers in the risk participation agreements through the same risk 

grading system currently utilized for 
establishing loss reserves in its loan and lease portfolio.

  The Bancorp incorporates the utilization of derivative instruments 
as part of its overall risk management strategy to reduce certain risks 
related to interest rate, prepaymen
t and foreign currency volatility. The Bancorp also holds derivatives instruments for the benefit of its 
commercial customers. For further information on derivative 

instruments, see Note 13.  
The Bancorp purchases life insurance policies on the lives of 
certain directors, officers and employees and is the owner and 

beneficiary of the policies. See Note 1 for further information. 

Certain BOLI policies have a stable value agreement through either 
a large, well-rated bank or multi-national insurance carrier that 
provides limited cash surrender value protection from declines in 

the value of each policy™s underl
ying investments. During 2009, the 
value of the investments underlying one of the Bancorp™s BOLI 

policies continued to decline due to disruptions in the credit 

markets, widening of credit spre
ads between U.S. treasuries/swaps versus municipal bonds and bank trust preferred securities, and 

illiquidity in the asset-backed securi
ties market. These factors caused 
the cash surrender value to decline further beyond the protection 

provided by the stable value agreement. As a result of exceeding the 

cash surrender value protection, 
the Bancorp recorded charges of 
$10 million during 2009 to reflect declines in the policy™s cash 
surrender value. The cash surrender
 value of this BOLI policy was 

$237 million at December 31, 2009.   
During 2009, the Bancorp notified the related insurance carrier 
of its intent to surrender this BOLI policy. Due to the fact the 

Bancorp had not yet decided the manner in which it would 

surrender the policy, which may have impacted the cash surrender 

value protection, and because of ongoing developments in litigation 

with the insurance carrier, the Bancorp recognized charges of $43 

million in 2009 to fully reserve for the potential loss of the cash 

surrender value protection associated
 with the policy. In addition, 
the Bancorp recognized tax benefits of $106 million in 2009 related 

to losses recorded in prior periods on this policy that are now 
expected to be tax deductible. 
During 2010, an agreement to 
settle the claims with the insurance carrier was reached among 
the parties to the litigation. As a result of this settlement and the corresponding receipt of 

settlement proceeds from the insurance carrier in the third quarter 

of 2010, the Bancorp recorded $152 million in other noninterest 
income and $25 million associated with legal fees related to the 
settlement in other noninterest expense in the Bancorp™s 

Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
114     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 CDC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bancorp, was created 
to invest in projects to create affordable housing, revitalize business 
and residential areas, and preserve historic landmarks, which are included above in partnership investments. The Bancorp has 
determined that these entities are VIEs and the Bancorp™s 
investments represent variable in
terests. See Note 11 for further 
information.  A bankers™ acceptance is created when a time draft is drawn on 
and accepted by a bank. By accepting the draft, the bank assumes 

the credit risk of the underlying obligor, usually the buyer or the 

seller of goods or their bank, and makes an unconditional promise 

to pay the holder of the draft the amount of the draft at maturity, 
which is generally less than one yea
r from the date of the draft. When the Bancorp is the accepting bank, it records the full amount 

of the acceptance in both other assets and other liabilities on the 

Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
On June 30, 2009, the Bancorp sold an approximate 51% 
interest in Vantiv Holding, 
LLC (formerly FTPS) to Advent 
International. The Bancorp™s remaining approximate 49% 

ownership in Vantiv Holding, LLC is accounted for under the 

equity method of accounting.  
OREO represents property acquired through foreclosure or 
other proceedings and is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, 

less costs to sell. See Note 1 for further information.
   15. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS Borrowings with original maturities 
of one year or less are classified 
as short term, and include federal funds purchased and other short-

term borrowings. Federal funds purchased are excess balances in 

reserve accounts held at Federal Reserve Banks that the Bancorp 

purchased from other member bank
s on an overnight basis. Other short-term borrowings include securities sold under repurchase 

agreements, derivative collater
al, FHLB advances and other

 PARENT COMPANY LONG-TERM BORROWINGS
  Senior Notes 
In April 2008, the Bancorp issued $750 million of senior notes to 
third party investors. The senior notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 
6.25% per annum. The Bancorp entered into interest rate swaps to 
convert $675 million to floating rate and, at December 31, 2011 and 
2010, paid a rate of 2.84% and 2.70%, respectively. The notes are 

unsecured, senior obligations of 
the Bancorp. Payment of the full 
principal amount of the notes will be due upon maturity on May 1, 

2013. The notes are not subject to redemption at the Bancorp's 

option at any time prior to maturity.  
On January 25, 2011, the Bancorp issued $1.0 billion of senior 
notes to third party investors. The Senior Notes bear a fixed rate of 

interest of 3.625% per annum. The Bancorp entered into interest 

rate swaps to convert $500 million to floating rate and, at December 

31, 2011, paid a rate of 0.26%. The notes are unsecured, senior 

obligations of the Bancorp. Payment of the full principal amounts 

of the notes is due upon maturi
ty on January 25, 2016. The notes are not subject to redemption at the Bancorp™s option at any time 
prior to maturity  Subordinated Debt 
The subordinated floating-rate notes due in 2016 pay interest at 

three-month LIBOR plus 42 bps. The Bancorp has entered into 

interest rate swaps to convert its subordinated fixed-rate notes due 

in 2017 and 2018 to floating-rate, which pay interest at three-month 

LIBOR plus 42 bps and 25 bps, respectively, at December 31, 2011.

 notes due in 2017 and 2018 were 0.82% and 0.78%, respectively, at 
December 31, 2011. Of the $1.0 billion in 8.25% subordinated fixed 

rate notes due in 2038, $705 million were subsequently hedged to 

floating and paid a rate of 3.58% at December 31, 2011.   
 Junior Subordinated Debt 
The 6.50% junior subordinated notes due in 2067, with a carrying 

and outstanding principal balance of $750 million at December 31, 2011, pay a fixed rate of 6.50% until 
2017, then convert to a floating 
rate at three-month LIBOR plus 137 bps until 2047. Thereafter, the 

notes pay a floating rate at one-month LIBOR plus 237 bps. Junior 

subordinated notes due in 2067, with a carrying amount of $594 
million and an outstanding principal balance of $575 million at 
December 31, 2011, pay a fixed rate of 7.25% until 2057, then 

convert to a floating rate at three-month LIBOR plus 257 bps. The 

Bancorp entered into interest rate swaps to convert $500 million of 

the fixed-rate debt into a floating rate. At December 31, 2011, the 

weighted-average rate paid on these swaps was 1.18%. Junior 

subordinated notes due in 2067, with a carrying amount of $894 

million and an outstanding principal balance of $863 million at 
December 31, 2011, pay a fixed rate of 7.25% until 2057, then 
convert to a floating rate at three-month LIBOR plus 303 bps 

thereafter. The Bancorp entered into interest rate swaps to convert 

$700 million of the fixed-rate debt into a floating rate. At December 

31, 2011, the weighted-average rate paid on the swaps was 1.61%. 

The obligations were issued to Fifth Third Capital Trusts IV, V and 

VI, respectively. The Bancorp has fully and unconditionally 

guaranteed all obligations under the 
trust preferred securities issued 
by Fifth Third Capital Trusts IV, V and VI. In addition, the 

Bancorp entered into replacement capital covenants for the benefit 

of holders of long-term debt senior
 to the junior subordinated notes 
that limits, subject to certain restrictions, the Bancorp™s ability to 
redeem the junior subordinated notes prior to their scheduled 

maturity. In November 2010, the Bancorp amended the debt 

covenants to remove a requirement to issue replacement capital 

securities at least 180 days prior to calling the trust preferred 
securities. Under recent regulatory developments, certain of the 
Bancorp™s trust preferred securities are callable at par as of certain 

dates, or may become callable at par under certain circumstances. 

On March 18, 2011, the Bancorp announced that the Federal 

Reserve Board did not object to the Bancorp™s capital plan 

submitted under the Federal Reserve™s 2011 CCAR.  Pursuant to 

this plan, the Bancorp redeemed $452 million of certain trust 
preferred securities, at par, classified as long-term debt during 2011. 
The trust preferred securities redeemed related to the Fifth Third 
Capital Trust VII, First National 
Bankshares Statutory Trust I and 
R&G Capital Trust II, LLT. As a result of these redemptions the 

Bancorp recorded a $6 million gain on the extinguishment within 

other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of 

Income. All redemptions are subj
ect to certain conditions and 
generally require approval by the FRB.  
 Structured Repurchase Agreements 
In order to meet its funding obligations, the Bancorp enters into 

repurchase agreements with customers, which are accounted for as 

collateralized financing transactions, where excess customer funds 

are borrowed overnight by the Bancorp, and later repurchased by 

the customers. At December 31, 2011, the total amount of 

repurchase agreements outstanding was $375 million. 
  
 
 
 SUBSIDIARY LONG-TERM BORROWINGS 
 Senior and Subordinated Debt 
Medium-term senior notes and subordinated bank notes with 

maturities ranging from one year to 30 years can be issued by the 

Bancorp™s banking subsidiary, of which $1.0 billion was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010 with $19.0 billion available for 

future issuance. The senior floating-rate bank notes due in 2013 pay 

a floating rate at three-month LIBOR plus 11 bps. For the 
subordinated fixed-rate bank notes due in 2015, the Bancorp 
entered into interest rate swaps to
 convert the fixed-rate debt into 
floating rate. At December 31, 2011, the weighted-average rate paid 

on the swaps was 0.53%. In addition to the aforementioned 

redemption of trust preferred securities, the Bancorp redeemed 

certain trust preferred securities of $65 million through the 

remainder of 2011, which related to the R&G Crown Cap Trust IV, 

the R&G Crown Cap Trust I and First National Bankshares 
Statutory Trust II. As a result of these redemptions, the Bancorp 
recorded a $1 million gain on the extinguishment within other 

noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.   
 Junior Subordinated Debt 
The junior subordinated floating-r
ate bank notes due in 2035 were 
assumed by a subsidiary of the Bancorp as part of the acquisition of 

First Charter in May 2008. The obligation was issued to First 
Charter Capital Trust I and II, respectively. The notes of First 
Charter Capital Trust I and II pay 
floating at three-month LIBOR 

plus 169 bps and 142 bps, respectively. The Bancorp has fully and 

unconditionally guaranteed all ob
ligations under the acquired trust 
preferred securities issued by First Charter Capital Trust I and II. As 
previously mentioned, in the junior subordinated debt section of the 
parent company long-term borrowings, the FRB did not object to 

the Bancorp™s capital plan under the Federal Reserve™s 2011 CCAR and therefore the Bancorp redeemed $65 million of trust preferred 

securities previously acquired by a 
Bancorp subsidiary, at par, during 
2011.  FHLB Advances 
At December 31, 2011, FHLB advances have rates ranging from 

0.05% to 8.34%, with interest pa
yable monthly. The advances are secured by certain residential mortga
ge loans and securities totaling $17.5 billion. At December 31, 2010, $500 million of FHLB 

advances were floating-rate. The Bancorp entered into an interest 

rate swap with a notional value of $500 million to convert the 

floating-rate advances to a fixed rate of 2.63%.  During the third 

quarter of 2011, the Bancorp terminated a $500 million FHLB 

advance and incurred a termination fee of $2 million within other 

noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  In 

November 2010, the Bancorp repaid a floating-rate advance of $1.0 
billion due in 2012 and terminated the interest rate cap associated 

with this advance. The Bancor
p recognized a gain on this 
extinguishment of debt of $1 million. The $1.1 billion in remaining 

advances mature as follows: $3 million in 2014, $5 million in 2015, 

$1 billion in 2016, and $43 million thereafter.  Notes Associated with
 Consolidated VIEs 
As previously discussed in Note 11, the Bancorp was determined to 
be the primary beneficiary of VIEs associated with certain 
automobile loan and home equity 
securitizations and, effective 
January 1, 2010, these VIEs ha
ve been consolidated in the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 

2011, the outstanding long-term debt associated with the 
automobile loan securitizations and home equity securitization was 

$171 million and $22 million, respectively. Third-party holders of 

this debt do not have recourse to the general assets of the Bancorp.

The Bancorp, in the normal course of business, enters into financial 
instruments and various agreements to meet the financing needs of 
its customers. The Bancorp also enters into certain transactions and 
agreements to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks, provide 

funding, equipment and locations fo
r its operations and invest in its 
communities. These instruments and agreements involve, to varying 
degrees, elements of credit risk, counterparty risk and market risk in 
excess of the amounts recognized in the Bancorp™s Consolidated 

Balance Sheets. The creditworthiness of counterparties for all 
instruments and agreements is evaluated on a case-by-case basis in 
accordance with the Bancorp™s credit policies. The Bancorp™s 

significant commitments, continge
nt liabilities and guarantees in 
excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance 

Sheets are discussed in further detail below:

  Commitments to extend credit 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend, typically 

having fixed expiration dates or ot
her termination clauses that may 
require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments to extend 

credit may expire without being 
drawn upon, the total commitment 
amounts do not necessarily represen
t future cash flow requirements. The Bancorp is exposed to credit risk in the event of 

nonperformance by the counterparty for the amount of the 

contract. Fixed-rate commitments 
are also subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and the Bancorp™s 
exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments. 

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bancorp had a reserve for 

unfunded commitments totaling $181 million and $227 million, 

respectively, included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance 

Sheets. The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with 

commitments to extend credit using the same risk rating system utilized within its loan and lease 
portfolio. Risk ratings under this risk rating system are summarized 
in the following table as of

respectively.  
 Standby letters of credit accounted for 98% of total letters of credit 
at December 31, 2011 compared to 99% at December 31, 2010 and 
are considered guarantees in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
Approximately 54% of the total standby letters of credit were fully 

secured as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. In the event of 

nonperformance by the customers, the Bancorp has rights to the 

underlying collateral, which can include commercial real estate, 

physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and 

marketable securities. At December 31, 2011 and 2010 the reserve 
related to these standby letters of credit was $5 million and $10 
million, respectively, included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated 
with letters of credit using the same risk rating system utilized within 
its loan and lease portfolio.

    At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bancorp had outstanding 
letters of credit that were suppor
ting certain securities issued as 
VRDNs. The Bancorp facilitates financing for its commercial 

customers, which consist of companies and municipalities, by 

marketing the VRDNs to investors. The VRDNs pay interest to 

holders at a rate of interest that fluctuates based upon market 
demand. The VRDNs generally have long-term maturity dates, but 
can be tendered by the holder for 
purchase at par value upon proper 
advance notice. When the VRDNs are tendered, a remarketing 
agent generally finds another investor to purchase the VRDNs to 

keep the securities outstanding in the market. As of December 31, 

2011 and 2010, FTS acted as the remarketing agent to issuers on 

$2.9 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, of VRDNs. As 
remarketing agent, FTS is responsible for finding purchasers for 

VRDNs that are put by investors. The Bancorp issues letters of 
credit, as a credit enhancement, to the VRDNs remarketed by FTS, 
in addition to $440 million and $563 million in VRDNs remarketed 

by third parties at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These 
letters of credit are included in the total letters of credit balance provided in the previous table. At December 31, 2011, FTS held an 

immaterial amount of these VRDN™s in its portfolio and classified 

them as trading securities, compared to $1 million at December 31, 

2010. In addition, at December 31, 2011, the Bancorp held an 
immaterial amount of VRDNs which were purchased from the 
market, through FTS and held in its trading securities portfolio, 

compared to $105 million at December 31, 2010. For the VRDNs 

remarketed by third parties, in some cases the remarketing agent has 

failed to remarket the securities and has instructed the indenture 

trustee to draw upon $11 million of letters of credit issued by the 

Bancorp at December 31, 2010. The amount of failed remarketing 

draws on letters of credit issued by the Bancorp was immaterial at 
December 31, 2011. The Bancorp recorded these draws as 
commercial loans in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
Forward contracts to sell mortgage loans 

The Bancorp enters into forward contracts to economically hedge 

the change in fair value of certain residential mortgage loans held 

for sale due to changes in interest rates. The outstanding notional 

amounts of these forward contracts are included in the summary of 
significant commitments table above for all periods presented. 
 Noncancelable lease obligations and other commitments 
The Bancorp™s subsidiaries have entered into a number of 

noncancelable lease agreements. The minimum rental commitments 

under noncancelable lease agreements
 are shown in the summary of 

significant commitments table. The Bancorp has also entered into a 
limited number of agreements for work related to banking center 
construction and to purchase goods or services.  

 Contingent Liabilities 
 
Private mortgage reinsurance 
For certain mortgage loans originated by the Bancorp, borrowers 

may be required to obtain PMI provided by third-party insurers. In 
some instances, these insurers cede a portion of the PMI premiums 
to the Bancorp, and the Bancorp provides reinsurance coverage 
within a specified range of the total PMI coverage. The Bancorp™s 

reinsurance coverage typically ranges from 5% to 10% of the total 

PMI coverage. The Bancorp™s maximum exposure in the event of 

nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the 

Bancorp™s total outstanding reinsurance coverage, which was $77 

million at December 31, 2011 and $115 million at December 31, 

2010. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bancorp maintained a 
reserve of $27 million and $42 million, respectively, related to 
exposures within the reinsurance portfolio which was included in 
other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the 

second quarter of 2009, the Bancorp suspended the practice of 

providing reinsurance of privat
e mortgage insurance for newly originated mortgage loans. In th
e third quarter of 2010, the Bancorp allowed one of its third-party insurers to terminate its reinsurance 

agreement with the Bancorp, resulting in the Bancorp releasing 
collateral to the insurer in the fo
rm of investment securities and 
other assets with a carrying value of $19 million, and the insurer 
assuming the Bancorp™s obligations under the reinsurance 

agreement, resulting in a decrease to the Bancorp™s reserve liability 

of $20 million and decrease in the Bancorp™s maximum exposure of 

$53 million. In the second quarter of 2011, the Bancorp allowed one 

of its third-party insurers to terminate its reinsurance agreement with the Bancorp, resulting in the Bancorp releasing collateral to the 
insurer in the form of investment 
securities and other assets with a 
carrying value of $5 million, and th
e insurer assuming the Bancorp™s obligations under the reinsurance ag
reement, resulting in a decrease 
to the Bancorp™s reserve liability of $11 million and decrease in the 
Bancorp™s maximum exposure of $27 million.   

 
Legal claims 

There are legal claims pending against the Bancorp and its 
subsidiaries that have arisen in 
the normal course of business. See 
Note 18 for additional information regarding these proceedings. 
 Guarantees 
The Bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of 
certain events under financial guarantees provided in certain 

contractual arrangements as discussed in the following sections. 

 Residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions 
Conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third 
parties are generally sold with representation and warranty 

provisions. A contractual liability aris
es only in the event of a breach of these representations and warranties and, in general, only when a 

loss results from the breach. The Bancorp may be required to 

repurchase any previously sold loan or indemnify (make whole) the 

investor or insurer for which the representation or warranty of the 
Bancorp proves to be inaccurate
, incomplete or misleading.   
 The Bancorp establishes a residential mortgage repurchase 
reserve related to various represen
tations and warranties that reflects management™s estimate of losses based on a combination of factors. Such factors incorporate historic
al investor audit and repurchase 
demand rates, appeals success rates and historical loss severity. At 
the time of a loan sale, the Bancorp records a representation and 

warranty reserve at the estimated fair value of the Bancorp™s 
guarantee and continually updates the reserve during the life of the 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
     Fifth Third Bancorp     119 
 loan as losses in excess of the reserve become probable and 
reasonably estimable. The provision 
for the estimated fair value of 
the representation and warranty guarantee arising from the loan 

sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale, which is 
included in other noninterest income at the time of sale. Updates to 

the reserve are recorded in other noninterest expense. The majority 

of repurchase demands occur within the first 36 months following 

origination.   
 As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bancorp maintained 

reserves related to these loans so
ld with representation and warranty 
provisions totaling $55 million and $85 million, respectively, 

included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The

  Residential mortgage loans sold with credit recourse 
The Bancorp sold certain residential mortgage loans in the 

secondary market with credit recourse. In the event of any customer 

default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, the Bancorp is 
required to reimburse the third party. The maximum amount of 
credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the underlying 

borrowers is equivalent to the 
total outstanding balance. In the 
event of nonperformance, the Bancorp has rights to the underlying 

collateral value securing the loan. 
The outstanding balances on these loans sold with credit recourse were $772 million and $916 million 

at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and the delinquency 

rates were 6.7% at December 31, 2011 and 8.7% at December 31, 
2010. The Bancorp maintained an estimated credit loss reserve on 
these loans sold with credit reco
urse of $17 million at December 31, 
2011 and $16 million at December 31, 2010 recorded in other 

liabilities in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. To determine the credit loss reserve, the Bancorp used an approach that is consistent 

with its overall approach in esti
mating credit losses for various 
categories of residential mortgage 
loans held in its loan portfolio.  Margin accounts 
FTS, a subsidiary of the Bancorp, guarantees the collection of all 
margin account balances held by its brokerage clearing agent for the 

benefit of its customers. FTS is responsible for payment to its 

brokerage clearing agent for any loss, liability, damage, cost or 

expense incurred as a result of cu
stomers failing to comply with 
margin or margin maintenance calls on all margin accounts. The 
margin account balance held by th
e brokerage clearing agent was 
$14 million at December 31, 2011 and $10 million at December 31, 
2010. In the event of any customer default, FTS has rights to the 

underlying collateral provided. Given the existence of the underlying 

collateral provided and negligible
 historical credit losses, the Bancorp does not maintain a loss reserve related to the margin 

accounts. 
 
Long-term borrowing obligations The Bancorp had fully and unconditionally guaranteed certain long-
term borrowing obligations issued by wholly-owned issuing trust 

entities of $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 
2010.  See Note 16 for further information on these long-term 
borrowing obligations.  
 
Visa litigation 
The Bancorp, as a member bank of Visa prior to Visa™s 

reorganization and IPO (the ﬁIPOﬂ) of its Class A common shares 
in 2008, had certain indemnification 
obligations pursuant to Visa™s 
certificate of incorporation and by
-laws and in accordance with their 
membership agreements. In accordance 
with Visa™s by-laws prior to the IPO, the Bancorp could have 
been required to indemnify Visa 
for the Bancorp™s proportional share of losses based on the pre-IPO 
membership interests. As part of its reorganization and IPO, the 

Bancorp™s indemnification obligati
on was modified to include only 
certain known litigation (the ﬁCovered Litigationﬂ) as of the date of 
the restructuring. This modification triggered a requirement to 
recognize a $3 million liability for the year ended December 31, 

2007 equal to the fair value of the indemnification obligation. 

Additionally during 2007, the Bancorp recorded $169 million for its 

share of litigation formally settled by Visa and for probable future 

litigation settlements. In conjunction with the IPO, the Bancorp 

received 10.1 million of Visa™s Class B shares based on the 

Bancorp™s membership percentage in Visa prior to the IPO. The 
Class B shares are not transferable (other than to another member 
bank) until the later of the third anniversary of the IPO closing or 

the date which the Covered Litigation has been resolved; therefore, 

the Bancorp™s Class B shares were classified in other assets and 

accounted for at their carryover basis of $0. Visa deposited $3 
billion of the proceeds from the IPO into a litigation escrow 

account, established for the purpose of funding judgments in, or 

settlements of, the Covered Litigation.
 If Visa™s litigation committee 
determines that the escrow accoun
t is insufficient, then Visa will 
issue additional Class A shares and deposit the proceeds from the 

sale of the shares into the litigation escrow account. When Visa 
funds the litigation escrow account, the Class B shares are subject to 
dilution through an adjustment in the conversion rate of Class B 

shares into Class A shares. During 2008, the Bancorp recorded 
additional reserves of $71 million for probable future settlements 

related to the Covered Litigation and recorded its proportional share 
of $169 million of the Visa escrow account net against the 
Bancorp™s litigation reserve. 

 During 2009, Visa announced 
it had deposited an additional $700 million into the litigation escrow account. As a result of this 

funding, the Bancorp recorded its proportional share of $29 million 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
120     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 of these additional funds as a reduction to its net Visa litigation 
reserve liability and a reduction to noninterest expense. Later in 

2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares 

for proceeds of $300 million. As part of this transaction the 
Bancorp entered into a total return swap in which the Bancorp will 
make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the 

conversion rate of the Class B shares into Class A shares. The swap 

terminates on the later of the third anniversary of Visa™s IPO or the 

date on which the Covered Litigation is settled. The Bancorp 

calculates the fair value of the swap based on its estimate of the 

probability and timing of certain Covered Litigation settlement 

scenarios and the resulting payments related to the swap. The 
counterparty to the swap as a result of its ownership of the Class B 

shares will be impacted by dilutive adjustments to the conversion 

rate of the Class B shares into Class A shares caused by any Covered 

Litigation losses in excess of the litigation escrow account. If actual 

judgments in, or settlements of, th
e Covered Litigation significantly 
exceed current expectations, then a
dditional funding by Visa of the 
litigation escrow account and the resulting dilution of the Class B 

shares could result in a scenario where the Bancorp™s ultimate 
exposure associated with the Covered Litigation (the ﬁVisa 
Litigation Exposureﬂ) exceeds the 
value of the Class B shares owned by the swap counterparty (the ﬁClass B Valueﬂ). In the event 
the Bancorp concludes that it is 
probable that the Visa Litigation 
Exposure exceeds the Class B Value,
 the Bancorp would record a 
litigation reserve liability and a corresponding amount of other 

noninterest expense for the amount of the excess. Any such 

litigation reserve liability would be separate and distinct from the 
fair value derivative liability associated with the total return swap. 
 As of the date of the Bancorp™s sale of Visa Class B shares and 

through December 31, 2011, the Bancorp has concluded that it is 
not probable that the Visa Litigation Exposure will exceed the Class 

B Value. Based on this determination, upon the sale of Class B 
shares, the Bancorp reversed its net Visa litigation reserve liability 

and recognized a free-standing deriva
tive liability associated with the 
total return swap with an initial fair
 value of $55 million. The sale of 
the Class B shares, recognition of the derivative liability and reversal 
of the net litigation reserve liability resulted in a pre-tax benefit of 

$288 million ($187 million after-tax) recognized by the Bancorp for 

the year ended December 31, 2009. In the second quarter of 2010, 

Visa funded an additional $500 million into the escrow account 

which resulted in further diluti
on in the conversion of Class B 
shares into Class A shares and required the Bancorp to make a $20 

million cash payment (which reduced the swap liability) to the swap 
counterparty in accordance with the terms of the swap contract. In 
the fourth quarter of 2010, Visa 
funded an additional $800 million 
into the litigation escrow account which resulted in further dilution 

in the conversion of Class B shares into Class A shares and required 
the Bancorp to make a $35 milli
on cash payment (which reduced 
the swap liability) to the swap co
unterparty in accordance with the 
terms of the swap contract. In the second quarter of 2011, Visa 

funded an additional $400 million into
 the litigation escrow account. 
Upon Visa™s funding of the litigation escrow account in the second 

quarter of 2011, along with additional terms of the total return 

swap, the Bancorp made a $19 milli
on cash payment (which reduced 
the swap liability) to the swap co
unterparty. During the fourth 
quarter of 2011, Visa announced it decided to fund an additional 
$1.565 billion into the litigation es
crow account which increased the 
swap liability approximately $54 million. The fair value of the swap 

liability was $78 million as of D
ecember 31, 2011, compared to $18 million at December 31, 2010. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 18. LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS 
During April 2006, the Bancorp was added as a defendant in a 
consolidated antitrust class action lawsuit originally filed against 
Visa®, MasterCard® and several other major financial institutions in 
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs, merchants operating commercial businesses 
throughout the U.S. and trade associations, claim that the 

interchange fees charged by card-issuing banks are unreasonable and 

seek injunctive relief and unspecified damages. In addition to being 

a named defendant, the Bancorp is also subject to a possible 

indemnification obligation of Visa as discussed in Note 17 and has 
also entered into with Visa, MasterCard and certain other named 
defendants judgment and loss shar
ing agreements that attempt to 
allocate financial responsibility to 
the parties thereto in the event certain settlements or judgments o
ccur. Accordingly, prior to the 
sale of Class B shares during 2009, the Bancorp had recorded a 

litigation reserve of $243 million to account for its potential 

exposure in this and related litigation. Additionally, the Bancorp had 

also recorded its proportional share of $199 million of the Visa escrow account funded with proceed
s from the Visa IPO along with 
several subsequent fundings. Upon the Bancorp™s sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares during 2009, and the 
recognition of the total return swap that transfers conversion risk 
of the Class B shares back to the 
Bancorp, the Bancorp reversed the remaining net litigation reserve 
related to the Bancorp™s exposure through Visa. Additionally, the 
Bancorp has remaining reserves related to this litigation of $49 
million and $30 million as of December 31, 2011, and 2010, 
respectively. Refer to Note 17 for further information regarding the 
Bancorp™s net litigation reserve and ownership interest in Visa. Fact 

and expert discovery in the litigation has been essentially completed. 

A motion for class action certification, certain defense motions to 

dismiss, and cross-motions for summary judgments are pending. A 

tentative date has been set fo
r the third quarter of 2012.  In September 2007, Ronald A. Katz Technology Licensing, 
L.P. (Katz) filed a suit in the Un
ited States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the Bancorp and its Ohio banking 

subsidiary. In the suit, Katz alleges that the Bancorp and its Ohio 

bank are infringing on Katz™s patents for interactive call processing technology by offering certain automated telephone banking and 

other services. This lawsuit is one of many related patent 

infringement suits brought by Katz in various courts against numerous other defendants. Katz is seeking unspecified monetary 
damages and penalties as well as
 injunctive relief in the suit. 
Management believes there are substantial defenses to these claims 

and intends to defend them vigorously. The impact of the final 

disposition of this lawsuit cannot
 be assessed at this time.  
For the year ended December 31, 2008, five putative securities 
class action complaints were filed 
against the Bancorp and its Chief 
Executive Officer, among other parties. The five cases have been 

consolidated under the caption Local 295/Local 851 IBT Employer 

Group Pension Trust and Welfare Fund v. Fifth Third Bancorp. et 
al., Case No. 1:08CV00421, and are currently pending in the United 
States District Court for the Southe
rn District of Ohio. The lawsuits 
allege violations of federal securities laws related to disclosures 

made by the Bancorp in press releases and filings with the SEC 

regarding its quality and sufficiency of capital, credit losses and 

related matters, and seeking unquantified damages on behalf of 

putative classes of persons who 
either purchased the Bancorp™s 
securities or trust preferred securities, or acquired the Bancorp™s 
securities pursuant to the acquisit
ion of First Charter Corporation. 
These cases remain in the discovery stages of litigation. The impact 
of the final disposition of these 
lawsuits cannot be assessed at this 
time. In addition to the foregoing, 
two cases were filed in the United 
States District Court for the Southe
rn District of Ohio against the 
Bancorp and certain officers alleging violations of ERISA based on 

allegations similar to those set fort
h in the securities class action 

cases filed during the same period
 of time. The two cases alleging violations of ERISA were dismisse
d by the trial court, and are being 
appealed to the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.  
On September 16, 2010, Edward P. Zemprelli (Zemprelli) filed 
a lawsuit in the Hamilton County
, Ohio Court of Common Pleas. 

The lawsuit was a purported derivative action brought by a 

shareholder of the Bancorp against certain of the Bancorp™s officers 

and directors, and which named the Bancorp as a nominal 

defendant. In the lawsuit, Zemprelli brought claims for breach of 

fiduciary duty, waste of corporat
e assets, and unjust enrichment against the defendant officers and directors. The alleged basis for 
these claims was that the defendant officers and directors attempted 
to disguise from the public the truth about the credit quality of the 

Bancorp™s loan portfolio, its capital position, and its need to raise 

capital. Zemprelli, on behalf of the Bancorp, brought unspecified 

money damages allegedly sustained by the Bancorp as a result of the 

defendants™ conduct, as well as in
junctive relief. On August 15, 2011, the Court granted defendants™ motion to dismiss and motion 

for summary judgment.  Zemprelli has filed a notice of appeal but 
later dismissed the appeal, as a result
 the trial court dismissal is final. In September 2011, DataTreasury Corporation filed a suit in 
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas 
against the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary. In the suit, 

DataTreasury alleges that the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary are 

infringing on DataTreasury™s patents for imaged-based check 

processing. This lawsuit is one of many related patent infringement 

suits brought by DataTreasury against numerous other defendants. 
DataTreasury is seeking unspecified monetary damages and 
penalties. Due to the recent filing of the lawsuit, management is in 

the process of reviewing the claims against the Bancorp and its 

banking subsidiary.  
The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are not parties to any other 
material litigation. However, there are other litigation matters that 

arise in the normal course of busi
ness. While it is impossible to 
ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with 
respect to these contingent matters, management believes any 
resulting liability from these other actions would not have a material 

effect upon the Bancorp™s consolidat
ed financial position, results of 
operations or cash flows.  
The Bancorp and/or its affiliates are or may become involved 
from time to time in information-gathering requests, reviews, 

investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by 

government and self-regulatory agencies, including the SEC, 
regarding their respective businesse
s. Such matters may result in 
material adverse consequences, incl
uding without limitation, adverse 
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, orders, injunctions or other 
actions, amendments and/or restatements of the Bancorp™s SEC 

filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or 

determinations of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls 

and procedures. The SEC is investigating and has made several 
requests for information, including by subpoena, concerning issues 
which the Bancorp understands relate to accounting and reporting 
matters involving certain of its co
mmercial loans. This could lead to 
an enforcement proceeding by the SEC which, in turn, may result in 

one or more such material adverse consequences.  
On May 16, 2011, the Bancorp caused a notice to be delivered 
to the trustee of Fifth Third Capital Trust VII (the ﬁTrustﬂ) to 

mandatorily redeem the 8.875% trust preferred securities of the 
Trust (the ﬁTrust Preferred Securitiesﬂ) at an aggregate cash 
redemption price of $25.18 per Trust Preferred Security. The Trust 
Preferred Securities were listed on the NYSE. The NYSE was 

notified of the redemption on May 17, 2011 and a Current Report 

on Form 8-K describing the redemption notice was filed by the 

Company with the SEC on May 18, 
2011. Trading in this security 
was halted by the NYSE shortly after this Form 8-K was filed and 

did not resume until May 19, 2011. The Trust Preferred Securities 

traded at prices above the redemption amount during the period 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
122     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 between the time the trustee was notified and before the Form 8-K 
describing the redemption was filed. The Bancorp was neither a 
party to nor a participant in any trading of the Trust Preferred 

Securities during such period or
 thereafter. On May 25, 2011, the 
Bancorp announced it would voluntarily compensate persons who 
purchased these Trust Preferred Securities after the redemption 

notice was delivered on May 16, 2011 and before trading was halted 

in the security on May 18, 2011. The compensation process was 

substantially completed by December 31, 2011 and Fifth Third paid 

out less than $1 million to affect
ed security holders who submitted claims. The SEC investigated and 
made requests for information, including by subpoena, concerning the circumstances and related 
issues surrounding the notification and disclosure process and 
timing thereof in connection with such redemption of the Trust 

Preferred Securities. The Bancorp cooperated with those requests. 

On August 1, 2011, the Bancorp received a ﬁWells noticeﬂ from the 

staff of the SEC advising the Bancorp that the staff has reached a 

preliminary conclusion to recommend that the Commission 

authorize the staff to file an enforcement action against the Bancorp 
relating to such matter for violation of Section 13(a) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Regulation FD. On November 
22, 2011 the Bancorp entered into a settlement with the SEC in 

connection with the alleged violation of Section 13(a) of the 

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Regulation FD.  Under the 

terms of the settlement, Fifth Third neither admitted nor denied 

such allegations and agreed to cease and desist from committing any 
violations and any future violations of Section 13(a) of the 

Exchange Act and Regulation FD. As noted in the order instituting 
the proceeding, in agreeing to this settlement, the SEC considered 
the remedial acts promptly and voluntarily undertaken by Fifth 

ThirdŠincluding its compensation of investors harmed by the 

timing of its disclosure and its adoption and implementation of 
additional policies and procedures relating to the redemption of 
securitiesŠand the cooperation 
it afforded the SEC staff.  
The Bancorp is party to numerous claims and lawsuits 
concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of litigation and the timing of ultimate 
resolution are inherently difficult to predict.  The following factors, 

among others, contribute to this lack of predictability: plaintiff 

claims often include significant le
gal uncertainties, damages alleged 
by plaintiffs are often unspecified or overstated, discovery may not 

have started or may not be complete and material facts may be 

disputed or unsubstantiated. As a result of these factors, the 

Bancorp is not always able to provide an estimate of the range of 
reasonably possible outcomes for each claim. A reserve for a 
potential litigation loss is established when information related to 

the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that 

the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such reserve is 

adjusted from time to time thereafter as appropriate to reflect 

changes in circumstances. The Bancorp also determines, when 

possible (due to the uncertainties described above), estimates of 

reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses, in 
excess of amounts reserved. Under U.S. GAAP, an event is 
ﬁreasonably possibleﬂ if ﬁthe chan
ce of the future event or events 
occurring is more than remote but 
less than likelyﬂ and an event is ﬁremoteﬂ if ﬁthe chance of the future event or events occurring is 

slight.ﬂ Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably 

possible loss for cases in which the Bancorp is able to estimate a 

range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range 

of loss for cases for which the Bancorp believes the risk of loss is 
more than slight.  For matters where the Bancorp is able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, the Bancorp 

currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur 

losses related to legal proceedings
 including the matters discussed 
above in an aggregate amount up to approximately $68 million in 

excess of amounts reserved, with it also being reasonably possible 

that no losses will be incurred in 
these matters.  The estimates 
included in this amount are based on the Bancorp™s analysis of 

currently available information, an
d as new information is obtained the Bancorp may change its estimates. 
For these matters and others where an unfavorable outcome is 
reasonably possible but not probabl
e, there may be a range of 
possible losses in excess of the established reserve that cannot be 

estimated.  Based on information currently available, advice of 

counsel, available insurance covera
ge and established reserves, the 
Bancorp believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against 

the Bancorp and/or its subsidiaries, including the matters described 
above, will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material 

adverse effect on the Bancorp™s consolidated financial position.  
However, in the event of unexpect
ed future developments, it is 
possible that the ultimate resolution 
of those matters, if unfavorable, 
may be material to Bancorp™s results of operations for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the size of the loss or liability 

imposed and the operating result
s for the applicable period. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 19. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The Bancorp maintains written policies and procedures covering 
related party transactions to principal shareholders, directors and 
executives of the Bancorp. These procedures cover transactions 
such as employee-stock purchase 
loans, personal lines of credit, 
residential secured loans, overdrafts, letters of credit and increases in 

indebtedness. Such transactions are subject to the Bancorp™s normal 

underwriting and approval procedures
. Prior to the closing of a loan 
to a related party, Compliance Risk Management must approve and 

determine whether the transaction requires approval from or a post 
notification be sent to the Bancorp™s Board of Directors. At 

December 31, 2011 and 2010, certain di
rectors, executive officers, 
principal holders of Bancorp common stock, associates of such 
persons, and affiliated companies of
 such persons were indebted, including undrawn commitments to lend, to the Bancorp™s banking 

subsidiary.  The following table summarizes th

its principal shareholders, directors and executives at December 31:

  The commitments to lend are in the form of loans and guarantees 

for various business and personal interests. This indebtedness was 
incurred in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same 
terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions
 with unrelated parties. This 
indebtedness does not involve more than the normal risk of 

repayment or present other features unfavorable to the Bancorp.  
On June 30, 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of a 
majority interest in its processing business, Vantiv Holding, LLC. 

Advent International acquired an
 approximate 51% interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC for cash an
d warrants. The Bancorp retained 
the remaining approximate 49% inte
rest in Vantiv Holding, LLC 
and, as part of the sale, Vantiv Holding, LLC assumed loans totaling 

$1.25 billion owed to the Bancorp. The Bancorp recognized $57 

million and $26 million, respectively, in noninterest income as part 

of its equity method investment in Vantiv Holding, LLC for the 

years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
 and received distributions 
totaling $3 million and $25 million, respectively, during 2011 and 
2010. The Bancorp and Vantiv Holding, LLC have various 
agreements in place covering services relating to the operations of 
Vantiv Holding, LLC. The services provided by the Bancorp to 

Vantiv Holding, LLC were required to support Vantiv Holding, 

LLC as a standalone entity during the deconversion period. These 

services involve transition support, including product development, 

risk management, legal, accounting and general business resources. 
Vantiv Holding, LLC paid the Ba
ncorp $21 million and $49 million, 
respectively, for these services for the years ended December 31, 

2011 and 2010. Other services provided to Vantiv Holding, LLC by 

the Bancorp, which will continue beyond the deconversion period, 

include treasury management, clea
ring, settlement, sponsorship, and 
data center support. Vantiv Hold
ing, LLC paid the Bancorp $37 
million and $34 million, respectively, for these services for the years 

ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. In 
addition to the previously 
mentioned services, the Bancorp entered into an agreement under 

which Vantiv Holding, LLC will pr
ovide processing services to the 
Bancorp. The total amount of fees relating to the processing 

services provided to the Bancorp by Vantiv Holding, LLC totaled 

$74 million and $64 million, respectively, for the years ended 

December 31, 2011 and 2010.  
During the fourth quarter of 2010, Vantiv Holding, LLC 
refinanced its debt into a larger syndicated loan structure that 
included the Bancorp. The Bancorp recognized $4 million in 
syndication fees in 2010 associated with the refinanced loan to 

Vantiv Holding, LLC. The outstand
ing balance of loans to Vantiv 
Holding, LLC was $377 million 
and $381 million at December 31, 
2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest
 income relating to the loans was $18 million, $102 million and $60 million, respectively, for the 
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 
and 2009 and is included in 
interest and fees on loans and leases in the Consolidated Statements 
of Income. Vantiv Holding, LLC™s line of credit was $50 million as 
of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Vantiv Holding, LLC did not draw 

upon its lines of credit during the years ended December 31, 2011 or 2010. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

taxation.  
During 2010, the Bancorp settled its outstanding dispute with 
the IRS relating to a specific capital raising transaction. This 

favorable settlement reduced income tax expense (including 

interest) by $19 million. During 2009, the Bancorp settled its 

outstanding dispute with the IRS re
lating to certain leveraged lease 
transactions. This favorable settlement reduced income tax expense 

(including interest) by $6 million and $55 million for 2010 and 2009, 

respectively.  During 2009, the Bancorp notified the carrier of one of the 
Bancorp™s policies of its intent to surrender a certain BOLI policy 

and was therefore required to establish a deferred tax asset relating 
to the difference between its financial reporting and tax basis of its 
investment. As a result, income tax expense for 2009 was favorably 

impacted by $106 million.

   The Bancorp™s unrecognized tax be
nefits as of December 31, 2011 
and 2010 relate largely to state income tax exposures from taking tax 

positions where the Bancorp believes it is likely that, upon 

examination, a state will take a position contrary to the position 

taken by the Bancorp. 
Substantially all of the reduction of unrecognized tax benefits 
during 2010 related to the settlement of the Bancorp™s dispute with 

the IRS relating to the specific capital raising transaction mentioned 

previously. Similarly, substantially all of the reduction of 

unrecognized tax benefits during
 2009 related to the settlement of 
certain leveraged lease transactions with the IRS.  
  While it is reasonably possible that the amount of the

  Deferred tax assets are included as a component of other assets in 

the Consolidated Balance Sheets 
and deferred tax liabilities are 
included as a component of accrued taxes, interest and expenses in 

the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bancorp had recorded 
deferred tax assets of $63 million and $66 million, respectively, 

related to state net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred tax 
assets relating to state net operating losses are presented net of 
specific valuation allowances, primarily resulting from leasing 

operations, of $34 million and $25 million at December 31, 2011 

and 2010, respectively. If these carry forwards are not utilized, they 

will expire in varying amounts through 2030. Additionally, at 

December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bancorp had federal general 

business tax credit carryforwards of $5 million and $45 million, 

respectively. If unused, these credit carryforwards will expire in 
2031.  The Bancorp has determined that
 a valuation allowance is not 
needed against the remaining deferred tax assets as of December 31, 
2011 or 2010. The Bancorp considered all of the positive and 

negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely 

than not that the deferred tax assets
 will ultimately be realized and, 
based upon that evidence, the Bancorp believes it is more likely than 

not that the deferred tax assets recorded at December 31, 2011 and 
2010 will ultimately be realized. The Bancorp reached this 
conclusion as the Bancorp has taxable income in the carryback 

period and it is expected that the Bancorp™s remaining deferred tax 
assets will be realized through the reversal of its existing taxable 

temporary differences and its projected future taxable income.  
As required under U.S. GAAP, the Bancorp established a 
deferred tax asset for stock-based awards granted to its employees. 

When the actual tax deduction for these stock-based awards is less 
than the expense previously recognized for financial reporting or when the awards expire unexerci
sed, the Bancorp is required to 
write-off the deferred tax asset pr
eviously established for these stock-based awards. As a result of
 the expiration of certain stock 
options and SARs and the lapse of restrictions on certain shares of 
restricted stock during the year ended December 31, 2011, the 
Bancorp recorded additional income tax expense of approximately 

$26 million related to the write-off of a portion of the deferred tax 
asset previously established. As a result of the Bancorp™s stock price 
as of December 31, 2011, it is reasonably possible that the Bancorp 
will be required to record an additional $21 million of income tax 

expense over the next twelve months, primarily in the second 

quarter of 2012. The Bancorp cannot predict its stock price or 

whether its employees will exercise other stock-based awards with 

lower exercise prices in the future; 
therefore, it is possible that the 
impact to income tax expense will be greater than or less than $21 

million over the next twelve months. 
The IRS concluded its audit for 2006 and 2007 during the third 
quarter of 2010. As a result, all issues have been resolved with the 

IRS through 2007. Further, the IRS has concluded its fieldwork on 

the Bancorp™s 2008 and 2009 fede
ral income tax returns. No 
material issues were identified as a result of the IRS audit and all 

significant issues have been resolved. The Bancorp anticipates that the IRS audit of the 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns will 

be completed during 2012. The statute of limitations for the 
Bancorp™s federal income tax returns remains open for tax years 
2008-2011. On occasion, as various state and local taxing 

jurisdictions examine the returns of the Bancorp and its subsidiaries, 

the Bancorp may agree to extend the statute of limitations for a 

short period of time. Otherwise, with the exception of a few states 

with insignificant uncertain tax positions, the statutes of limitations 

for state income tax returns remain open only for tax years in 

accordance with each state™s statutes. 
Any interest and penalties incurred in connection with income 
taxes are recorded as a componen
t of income tax expense in the 

Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended 

December 31, 2011, the Bancorp recognized interest expense of $1 

million, net of the related tax impact related to interest and 

penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Bancorp 

recognized an interest benefit incurred in connection with income 

taxes of $8 million, net of the re
lated tax impact. At December 31, 
2011 and 2010, the Bancorp had accrued interest liabilities, net of 

the related tax benefits, of $3 million and $1 million, respectively. 

No material liabilities were recorded for penalties. 
Retained earnings at December 31, 2011 and 2010 included 
$157 million in allocations of earnings for bad debt deductions of 

former thrift subsidiaries for which no income tax has been 

provided. Under current tax law, if certain of the Bancorp™s 
subsidiaries use these bad debt reserves for purposes other than to 
absorb bad debt losses, they will be subject to federal income tax at 
the current corporate tax rate.

  21. RETIREMENT AND BENEFIT PLANS The Bancorp™s qualified defined benefit plan™s benefits were frozen 
in 1998, except for grandfathered employees. The Bancorp™s other 
retirement plans consist of nonqualified, supplemental retirement 

plans, which are funded on an as needed basis. A majority of these 

plans were obtained in acquisiti
ons from prior years. The Bancorp 
recognizes the overfunded and un
derfunded status of its pension 
plans as an asset and liability, re
spectively. The overfunded and 
underfunded amounts recognized in other assets and other

 The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used 
for instruments measured at fair 
value, as well as the general 
classification of such instrumen
ts pursuant to the valuation 
hierarchy. 
 
Equity securities
 The plan measures common stock using quoted prices which are 

available in an active market and 
classifies these investments within 
Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. 

 
Mutual and exchange traded funds 

All of the plan™s mutual and exch
ange traded funds are publicly 
traded. The plan measures the valu
e of these investments using the fund™s quoted prices that are ava
ilable in an active market and 
classifies these investments wi
thin Level 1 of the valuation 
hierarchy.  
 
Debt securities 
For certain U.S. Treasury obligati
ons and federal agency securities, the plan measures the fair value based on quoted prices, which are 
available in an active market and 
classifies these investments within 
Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Where quoted prices are not 

available, the plan measures the fair value of these investments 

based on matrix pricing models that include the bid price, which 

factors in the yield curve and other characteristics of the security 

including the interest rate, prepayment speeds and length of 
maturity. Therefore, these investments are classified within Level 2 
of the valuation hierarchy.  Plan Assumptions 
The plan assumptions are evaluated annually and are updated as 

necessary. The discount rate a
ssumption reflects the yield on a 
portfolio of high quality fixed-
income instruments that have a 

similar duration to the plan™s liabilit
ies. The expected long-term rate 
of return assumption reflects the average return expected on the 
assets invested to provide for th
e plan™s liabilities. In determining 
the expected long-term rate of return, the Bancorp evaluated 
actuarial and economic inputs, incl
uding long-term inflation rate 
assumptions and broad equity an
d bond indices long-term return 
projections, as well as actual long-term historical plan performance. 
 The following table summarizes the plan a
ssumptions for the years ended December 31:

     Fifth Third Bancorp     129 
 Lowering both the expected rate of return on the plan and the 
discount rate by 0.25% would have increased the 2011 pension 

expense by approximately $1 million. 
Based on the actuarial assumptions, the Bancorp does not 
expect to contribute to the plan in 2012. Estimated pension benefit 

payments, which reflect expected future service, are $20 million in 

2012, $17 million in 2013, $16 million in 2014, $16 million in 2015 

and $15 million in 2016. The total es
timated payments for the years 
2017 through 2021 is $66 million.  Investment Policies and Strategies 
The Bancorp™s policy for the investment of plan assets is to employ 
investment strategies that achieve a range of weighted-average target 
asset allocations relating to equity s
ecurities (including the Bancorp™s 
common stock), fixed income securities (including federal agency 

obligations, corporate bonds and notes) and cash.  
 The following table provides the Bancorp™s targeted and actual weighted-average asset allocations by asset category for the yea

The risk tolerance for the plan is determined by management to be 

ﬁmoderate to aggressiveﬂ, recognizing that higher returns involve 

some volatility and that periodic dec
lines in the portfolio™s value are 

tolerated in an effort to achieve real capital growth. There were no 

significant concentrations of risk associated with the investments of 
the Bancorp™s benefit and retirement plan at December 31, 2011 
and 2010. Permitted asset classes of the plan include cash and cash 
equivalents, fixed income (domes
tic and non-U.S. bonds), equities 
(U.S., non-U.S., emerging markets and REITS), equipment leasing 

precious metals, commodity transactions and mortgages. The plan 

utilizes derivative instruments including puts, calls, straddles or 

other option strategies, as approved by management.     
Prohibited asset classes of the plan include venture capital, 
short sales, limited partnerships and leveraged transactions. Per 

ERISA, the Bancorp™s common stock cannot exceed ten percent of 

the fair value of plan assets.   
Fifth Third Bank, as Trustee, is expected to manage the plan 
assets in a manner consistent with the plan agreement and other 

regulatory, federal and state laws. The Fifth Third Bank Pension, 

Profit Sharing and Medical Plan Committee (the ﬁCommitteeﬂ) is 

the plan administrator. The Trustee is required to provide to the 
Committee monthly and quarterly re
ports covering a list of plan 
assets, portfolio performance, transactions and asset allocation. The 
Trustee is also required to keep
 the Committee apprised of any 
material changes in the Trustee™s outlook and recommended 
investment policy.  Other Information on Retirement and Benefit Plans 
The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans was 
$253 million and $227 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010,

$5 million of Bancorp common stock as of December 31, 2011 and 

2010. Plan assets are not expected 
to be returned to the Bancorp during 2012. 
The Bancorp™s profit sharing plan expense was $35 million for 
2011, $31 million for 2010, and $17 million for 2009. Expenses 

recognized for matching contribu
tions to the Bancorp™s defined 
contribution savings plans were $40 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2011, and $36 million for the years ended December

      In 2008, the Bancorp issued 
8.5% non-cumulative Series G convertible preferred stock. The depository shares represent shares 
of its convertible preferred stock and has a liquidation preference of 

$25,000 per share. The preferred stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the shareholder, in
to 2,159.8272 shares of common 
stock, representing a conversion 
price of approximately $11.575 per 
share of common stock.  
On December 31, 2008, the U.S. Treasury purchased $3.4 
billion, or 136,320 shares, of the 
Bancorp™s Fixed Rate Cumulative 
Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series 
F, with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share and related 10-year warrant in the amount of 15% 

of the preferred stock investment. The warrant gave the U.S 

Treasury the right to purchase 43,617,747 shares of the Bancorp™s 

common stock at $11.72 per share. The Series F senior preferred 

stock was issued complying with the terms established by the CPP. 
Per the program terms, the U.S. Tr
easury™s investment consisted of 
senior preferred stock with a five percent dividend for each of the 
first five years of investment and nine percent thereafter, unless the 

shares were redeemed. The shares were callable by the Bancorp at 

par after three years and could be repurchased at any time under 

certain circumstances. The terms also included restrictions on the 

repurchase of common stock and an increase in common stock 

dividends, which required the U.S. Treasury™s consent, for a period 
of three years from the date of investment unless the preferred 

shares were redeemed in whole or the U.S. Treasury had transferred 

all of the preferred shares to a third party.   
The proceeds from issuance of the Series F preferred stock 
were allocated to the preferred stock and to the warrant based on 

their relative fair values, which resulted in an initial book value of 

$3.2 billion for the preferred stock and $239 million for the warrant. 

The resulting discount to the preferred stock was being accreted 
over five years through retained earnings as a preferred stock 
dividend, resulting in an effectiv
e yield of 6.7% for the Series F 
preferred stock for the first five years.  
On May 7, 2009, the Bancorp announced the SCAP results. 
While not required to raise additional overall capital, the Bancorp 

was required to augment its existing capital base to maintain a 

capital buffer above the newly required four percent threshold of 

the Tier I common equity ratio. As a result, the Bancorp initiated a 
number of capital actions including the offer to exchange Series G 
preferred shares and a common stock offering. 
On June 4, 2009, the Bancorp announced the successful 
completion of a $1.0 billion at-the-market offering of its common 

shares. Through this offering, the Bancorp issued approximately 158 

million shares at an average price of $6.33.    
On June 17, 2009, the Bancorp completed its offer to exchange 
2,158.8272 shares of its common stock, no par value, and $8,250 in 

cash, for each set of 250 validly tendered and accepted depositary 
shares. The Bancorp issued approximately 60 million shares of 
common stock and paid $230 million in cash in exchange for 7 

million depositary shares. Overall, $696 million in liquidation 

amount of the Bancorp™s depositary shares were validly tendered, 

not withdrawn and exchanged, which represented 63% of the 

aggregate liquidation amount of it
s depositary shares. An aggregate of 7 million depositary shares representing 27,849 shares of Series G 

preferred stock were retired upon receipt. At the time of exchange, 

the Bancorp recognized an increase
 to retained earnings and net income available to common sharehol
ders of $35 million, calculated 
as the difference between the carrying amount of the Series G 

preferred stock exchanged and the sum of the fair value of the 

common stock plus cash delivered. As a result of this exchange, the 

Bancorp increased its common equity by $441 million. As of 
December 31, 2011, Series G preferred stock had 4,112,750 
depositary shares representing 16
,450 shares outstanding and 1,700 
shares reserved for issuance. 
On January 25, 2011, the Bancorp raised $1.7 billion in new 
common equity through the issuance of 121,428,572 shares of 
common stock in an underwritten offering with an initial price of 

$14.00 per share. On January 24, 
2011, the underwriters exercised 
their option to purchase an additional 12,142,857 shares at the 
offering price of $14.00 per share. 
In connection with this exercise, 
the Bancorp entered into a forward 
sale agreement which resulted in 
a final net payment of 959,821 shares on February 4, 2011. On 
February 2, 2011, the Bancorp used these proceeds along with 

proceeds from a senior debt offering and other available resources 

to repurchase all 136,320 Series F preferred shares. In connection 

with the redemption of the Series F Preferred Stock, the Bancorp 

accelerated the accretion of the remaining issuance discount on the 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
132     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 Series F Preferred Stock and recorded a reduction in retained 
earnings and a corresponding incr
ease in preferred stock of $153 million in the Bancorp™s Consolidated Balance Sheet.  On March 16, 

2011, the Bancorp repurchased the warrant issued to the U.S. 
Treasury in connection with the CPP preferred stock investment at 
an agreed upon price of $280 million, which was recorded as a 

reduction to capital surplus in the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial 
Statements.  During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Bancorp repurchased an 
immaterial amount of common stock.
   24. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
The Bancorp has historically emphasized employee stock 

ownership. The following table pr

itions. The Bancorp has not made 
any awards under these plans and 
will make no additional awards under these plans. The weighted-ave
rage exercise price of the outs
tanding options is $16.31 per 
share.  
 (d) Phantom stock units are settled in cash. 
(e) The number of shares to be issued is dependent upon the Bancor
p achieving certain predefined performance targets and ranges fro
m zero shares to approximately 1.5 million shares. 
(f) Represents remaining shares of Fifth Third common stock under the Bancorp™s 1993 Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated, 
including an additional 1.5 millio
n shares approved by shareholders 
on March 28, 2007 and an additional 12 million sh
ares approved by shareholders on April 21, 2009. 
 Stock-based awards are eligible for issuance under the Bancorp™s 

Incentive Compensation Plan to key employees and directors of the 

Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Incentive Compensation Plan was 
approved by shareholders on April 19, 2011, which authorizes the 

issuance of up to 39 million shares
 plus up to 4.5 million shares under the Predecessor Plan for Full Value Awards as equity 

compensation and provides for incentive and nonqualified stock 

options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, and performance share and restricted stock awards. Full 

Value Awards are defined as awards with no cash outlay for the 

employee to obtain the full value. Based on total stock-based awards 

outstanding (including stock opt
ions, stock appreciation rights, 
restricted stock and performance units) and shares remaining for 
future grants under the 2011 Incentive Compensation Plan, the 
Bancorp™s total overhang is nine percent. The overhang 

measurement represents the pot
ential dilution to which the 
Bancorp™s shareholders of common stock are exposed due to the 

potential that stock-based compensation will be awarded to 

executives, directors or key employees of the Bancorp. SARs, 

restricted stock, stock options and performance units outstanding represent six percent of the Bancorp™s issued shares at December 
31, 2011. All of the Bancorp™s stock-based awards are to be settled with 
stock with the exception of phantom stock units and a portion of 
the performance units that are to be settled in cash. The Bancorp 

has historically used treasury stock to settle stock-based awards, 
when available. SARs, issued at fair value based on the closing price 
of the Bancorp™s common stock on the date of grant, have up to 

ten-year terms and vest and become 
exercisable either ratably or fully over a four year period of continued employment. The 

Bancorp does not grant discounted SARs or stock options, re-price 

previously granted SARs or stock options, or grant reload stock 
options. Restricted stock grants vest after four years, or ratably over 
three or four years or ratably after three years of continued 

employment and include dividend and voting rights. Stock options 

were previously issued at fair va
lue based on the closing price of the 
Bancorp™s common stock on the date of grant, had up to ten-year 

terms and vested and became fully exercisable ratably over a three 

or four year period of continued employment. Performance unit 

awards have three-year cliff vesting terms with performance or market conditions as defined by the plan. 
Stock-based compensation expense was $59 million, $64 
million and $51 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 
2010 and 2009, respectively, and is in
cluded in salaries, wages, and 
incentives in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total 

related income tax benefit recognized was $21 million for 2011 and 

$18 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, 

respectively.   Stock Appreciation Rights 
The Bancorp uses assumptions, which are evaluated and revised as 
necessary, in estimating the grant-da
te fair value of each SAR grant.

        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
     Fifth Third Bancorp     133 
 The expected life is derived from historical exercise patterns and 
represents the amount of time that options granted are expected to 

be outstanding. The expected volatility is based on a combination of 

historical and implied volatilities 
of the Bancorp™s common stock. 
The expected dividend yield is based on annual dividends divided by 
the Bancorp™s stock price. Annual dividends are based on projected 
dividends, estimated using a hist
orical long-term dividend payout 
ratio, over the estimated life of the awards. The risk-free interest 

rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on 

the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.   
The grant-date fair value of SARs is measured using the Black-
Scholes option-pricing model.
 The weighted-average grant-date fair 
value of SARs granted was $4.29, $5.10 and $2.41 per share for the 

years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009, resp
ectively. The total grant-date 
fair value of SARs that vested during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $20 

million, $25 million, and $26 million, respectively.   
At December 31, 2011, there was $47 million of stock-based 
compensation expense related to nonvested SARs not yet 

recognized. The expense is expected to be recognized over a 

remaining weighted-average period of approximately 2.7 years.

The grant-date fair value of stock options is measured using the 
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. There were no stock options 
granted during 2011 and 2010. Stock options granted during 2009 

were immaterial to the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial 

Statements.  The total intrinsic value of options exercised was immaterial to 
the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements in 2011, 2010 and 
2009. Cash received from options exercised during 2011 was $1 
million and was immaterial to the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial 
Statements in 2010 and 2009. Tax bene
fits realized from exercised options were immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
during 2011, 2010 and 2009. All stock options were vested at 

December 31, 2008, therefore, no stock options vested during 2011, 

2010, or 2009. As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate intrinsic 

value of both outstanding options and exercisable options was immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2009, the Bancorp™s Board of Directors approved the use of 

phantom stock units as part of its compensation for executives in 
connection with changes made in reaction to the TARP 

compensation rules. On February
 22, 2011, the Bancorp redeemed 
its Series F preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury under the 

CPP. As a result of this redemption, the last payment of phantom 

stock occurred in April of 2011. The phantom stock units were 

issued under the Bancorp™s 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan. The 

number of phantom stock units was determined each pay period by 

dividing the amount of salary to be paid in phantom stock units for 

that pay period, by the reported closing price of the Bancorp™s 
common stock on the pay date for such pay period. The phantom 

stock units vest immediately. Phantom stock was expensed based on 

the number of outstanding units mu
ltiplied by the closing price of the Bancorp™s stock at period end. The phantom stock units did not 

include any rights to receive divi
dends or dividend equivalents. 
Phantom stock units issued on or before June 12, 2010 were settled 

in cash upon the earlier to occur of June 15, 2011 or the executive™s 

death. Units issued thereafter will be settled in cash with 50% to be 

settled on June 15, 2012 and 50% to be settled on June 15, 2013. 

The amount paid on settlement of the phantom stock units is equal 

to the total amount of phantom stock units settled at the reported 

closing price of the Bancorp™s common stock on the settlement

respective phantom stock units were granted with a weighted 

average grant price of $14.40 and $12.80, during the years ended 

December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2011, 521,091 
phantom stock units were settled. No phantom stock units were 
settled during 2010.  Performance units are payable contingent upon the Bancorp 
achieving certain predefined performance targets over the three-year

entirely settled in stock. During 2009, the awards granted are 
payable 50% in stock and 50% in cash. The performance targets are 

based on the Bancorp™s performance relative to a defined peer

rred dividends of $14 for Series G 
preferred shares, offset by a $35 
reduction to preferred dividends due to the conversion of a po
rtion of Series G preferred shares during the second quarter of 2
009.
 B Shares are excluded from the computation of net income per diluted 
share when their inclusion has an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per 
share. The diluted earnings per share computation for the years 
2011, 2010, and 2009 excludes 29 million, 23 million, and 23 

million, respectively, of stock appreciation rights, 8 million, 12 

million, and 17 million, respectively, of stock options and 1 million,  

1 million and 4 million shares, respectively, of unvested restricted 

stock that had not yet been exercised. In 2010,  36 million shares 

related to the Bancorp™s Series G preferred stock that were not part 

of the conversion of preferred shares in the second quarter of 2009 

were excluded from the computation of net income per diluted 
share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to 
earnings per share.  
For the year ended December 31, 2009, there were 44 million shares under warrants related to the Bancorp™s Series F preferred 
stock from the CPP that were excluded from the computation of 

net income per diluted share, as their inclusion would have been 

anti-dilutive to earnings per share 
due to the exercise price of the 

shares being greater than the average market price of the common 
shares. The warrants had an initial exercise price of $11.72 per share.

 27. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair 
value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the 
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction be
tween market participants at the 
measurement date. U.S. GAAP als
o establishes a fair value 

hierarchy, which prioritizes the i
nputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value 

hierarchy gives the highest priori
ty to quoted prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest 

priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A financial instrument™s 
categorization within the fair v
alue hierarchy is based upon the 
lowest level of input that is signif
icant to the instrument™s fair value 
measurement. For more information regarding the fair value 

hierarchy and how the Bancorp measures fair value, see Note 1.

(b) Includes residential mortgage loans orig

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used 
for significant instruments measured 
at fair value, as well as the 
general classification of such inst
ruments pursuant to the valuation 
hierarchy. Residential mortgage loans held for sale that are 
reclassified to held for investment are transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as described below. It is the 

Bancorp™s policy to value any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy based on end of period fair values. 

 Available-for-sale an
d trading securities 
Where quoted prices are available in 
an active market, securities are 
classified within Level 1 of the valu
ation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include government bonds and exchange traded equities. If quoted 
market prices are not available, then
 fair values are estimated using 
pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar 

characteristics, or discounted 
cash flows. Examples of such 
instruments, which are classified within Level 2 of the valuation 
hierarchy, include agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. 

Government sponsored agencies, and corporate and municipal 

bonds. Agency mortgage-backed securities, obligations of U.S. 

Government sponsored agencies, and corporate and municipal 

bonds are generally valued using a market approach based on 

observable prices of securities with similar characteristics.  
Non-agency mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities are generally valued us
ing an income approach based on 
discounted cash flows, incorporating prepayment speeds, 

performance of underlying collateral and specific tranche-level 

attributes. In certain cases where 
there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the va
luation, securities are classified 
within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Trading securities 

classified as Level 3 consist of au
ction rate securities. Due to the 
illiquidity in the market for these types of securities at December 31, 
2011 and 2010, the Bancorp measured fair value using a discount 
rate based on the assumed holding period. 

 
Residential mortgage loans held fo
r sale and held for investment For residential mortgage loans held 
for sale, fair value is estimated 

based upon mortgage-backed securiti
es prices and spreads to those 
prices or, for certain ARM loans, DCF models that may incorporate 

the anticipated portfolio composition,
 credit spreads of asset-backed 
securities with similar collateral and market conditions. The 
anticipated portfolio composition includes the effect of interest rate 
spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as the 

state in which the loan was orig
inated, the loan amount and the 
ARM margin. Residential mortgage loans held for sale that are 

valued based on mortgage backed s
ecurities prices are classified 
within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as the valuation is based on 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
     Fifth Third Bancorp     139 
 external pricing for similar instruments. ARM loans classified as 
held for sale are also classified within Level 2 of the valuation 
hierarchy due to the use of observable inputs in the DCF model. 

These observable inputs include interest rate spreads from agency 
mortgage-backed securities market
 rates and observable discount 
rates. For residential mortgage loans reclassified from held for sale 
to held for investment, the fair value estimation is based on 

mortgage-backed securities prices 
and a credit component that is 
based on internally developed loss rate models. Therefore, these 

loans are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 

 
Derivatives 
Exchange-traded derivatives valued using quoted prices and certain 
over-the-counter derivatives valued using active bids are classified 

within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Most derivative contracts 

are valued using discounted cash
 flow or other models that 
incorporate current market interest rates, credit spreads assigned to 

the derivative counterparties and other market parameters and, 

therefore, are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 

Such derivatives include basic and st
ructured interest rate swaps and 
options. Derivatives that are valued based upon models with 
significant unobservable market parameters are classified within 
Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, 

derivatives classified as Level 3, which are valued using an option-

pricing model containing unobservable inputs, consisted primarily 
of warrants and put rights associated
 with the sale of the processing 
business to Advent International and a total return swap associated 
with the Bancorp™s sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. Level 3 

derivatives also include interest rate lock commitments, which 

utilize internally generated loan 
closing rate assumptions as a significant unobservable input in the valuation process.  
In connection with the sale of the processing business, the 
Bancorp provided Advent International with certain put options 
that are exercisable in the event of certain circumstances. In 
addition, the associated warrants allow the Bancorp to purchase an 

incremental 10% nonvoting interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC under 
certain defined conditions involving change of control. The fair 

values of the warrants and put options are calculated applying 
Black-Scholes option valuation models using probability weighted 

scenarios. The assumptions utilize
d in the models are summarized 
in the following table as of December 31:

(b) Historically, three scenarios have been used
 to estimate the fair value of the put options. Two of the scenarios™ terms expired
 prior to December 31, 2011. Therefor
e, the assumptions at December 31, 
2011 only include one scenario. 
Under the terms of the total return swap, the Bancorp will make or 

receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion 
rate of the Visa, Inc. Class B shares into Class A shares. The fair 
value of the total return swap was calculated using a discounted cash 

flow model based on unobservable inputs consisting of 

management™s estimate of the probability of certain litigation 

scenarios, timing of litigation settlements and payments related to 
the swap. The net fair value of the intere
st rate lock commitments at December 31, 2011 was $33 million. Immediate decreases in current 
interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in increases in the 
fair value of the interest rate 
lock commitments of approximately 
$16 million and $28 million, respectively. Immediate increases of 

current interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps would result in decreases 

in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitments of 

approximately $20 million and $45 million, respectively. The 

decrease in fair value of interest rate lock commitments due to 

immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in the assumed loan 
closing rates would be approximately $4 million and $7 million, 
respectively, and the increase in fair value due to immediate 10% 

and 20% favorable changes in the assumed loan closing rates would 

be approximately $3 million and $6 million, respectively. These 

sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution, as 

changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions typically 

cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in 

assumptions to the change in f
air value may not be linear.

 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a 
Nonrecurring Basis 
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis. These assets 
and liabilities are not measured at 
fair value on an ongoing basis; 
however, they are subject to fair 
value adjustments in certain circum
stances, such as when there is 
evidence of impairment. The following tables represent those assets 
that were subject to fair value adjustments during the years ended 

December 31, 2011 and 2010 and still held as of the end of the 

period, and the related losses from fair value adjustments on assets 
sold during the period as well as assets still held as of the end of the

(a) Includes commercial nonaccrual loans held for sale. 
During 2011, the Bancorp transferred $143 million of commercial 

loans from the portfolio to loans held for sale that upon transfer 

were measured at fair value. These loans had fair value adjustments 
totaling $31 million and were based on discounted cash flow models 
incorporating appraisals of the un
derlying collateral, as well as 
assumptions about investor return requirements and amounts and 

timing of expected cash flows, and were therefore, classified within 

Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Additionally, during 2011, 

existing commercial loans held for sale with a fair value of $48 
million were further adjusted using the same methodology as loans 

transferred to held for sale. Therefore, these loans were classified 
within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
During 2011 and 2010, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring 
impairment adjustments to cert
ain commercial and industrial, 
commercial mortgage and commercial construction loans held for 
investment. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of 

the underlying collateral supporting 
the loan and were classified 
within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. In cases where the 

carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is 
recognized. The fair values and 
recognized impairment losses are reflected in the previous table. 
During 2011, the Bancorp recognized temporary impairments 
in certain classes of the MSR port
folio in which the carrying value 
was adjusted to fair value as of December 31, 2011. MSRs do not 
trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. While 

sales of MSRs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically 

are not readily available. Accordingly, the Bancorp estimates the fair 
value of MSRs using discounted cash flow models with certain 
unobservable inputs, primarily prepayment speed assumptions, 
resulting in a classification within 
Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
Refer to Note 12 for further information on the Bancorp™s MSRs. 
During the 2011 and 2010, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring 
adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate 

properties classified as OREO and measured at the lower of 

carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. Nonrecurring losses 
included in the above table are primarily due to declines in real 
estate values of the OREO properties. These losses include $100 

million in losses, recorded as charge-offs, on new OREO properties 
transferred from loans during the period and $71 million in losses, 
recorded in other noninterest income, attributable to fair value 
adjustments on OREO properties subsequent to their transfer from 

loans. Such fair value amounts are generally based on appraisals of 

the property values, resulting in a classification within Level 3 of the 

valuation hierarchy. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the 

fair value, less costs to sell, an
 impairment loss is recognized. The 
previous tables reflect the fair 
value measurements of the properties 
before deducting the estimated costs to sell. 
 Fair Value Option 
The Bancorp elected to measure certain residential mortgage loans 
held for sale under the fair value option as allowed under U.S. 

GAAP. Management™s intent to sell residential mortgage loans 

classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors 

as changes in the overall liquidity in markets or changes in 

characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. Consequently, these loans may be reclassified to loans held for investment and 
maintained in the Bancorp™s loan por
tfolio. In such cases, the loans 
will continue to be measured at fair value. Residential loans with fair 

values of $24 million and $26 million were transferred to the 

Bancorp™s portfolio during 2011 and 2010, respectively. The net 

impact related to fair value adjustments on these loans was a gain of 

$4 million during 2011.  Fair value adjustments on residential 

mortgage loans transferred to th
e Bancorp™s portfolio during 2010 
were immaterial.  
Fair value changes included in ea
rnings for instruments held at 
December 31, 2011 and 2010 for which the fair value option was 

elected included gains of $123 million and $25 million, respectively. 

Additionally, fair value changes incl
uded in earnings for instruments 
for which the fair value option was 
elected but are no longer held by 
the Bancorp at December 31, 2011 and 2010 included gains of $168 

million and $171 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively. These

 gains are reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income.  
Valuation adjustments related to 
instrument-specific credit risk for residential mortgage loans measured at fair value negatively 
impacted the fair value of those loans by $3 million at December 31, 
2011 and $5 million at December 31, 2010. Interest on residential 
mortgage loans measured at fair value is accrued as it is earned using 

the effective interest method and is reported as interest income in 

the Consolidated Statements of Income.

For financial instruments with a short-term or no stated maturity, 

prevailing market rates and limited credit risk, carrying amounts 

approximate fair value. Those financial instruments include cash and 

due from banks, FHLB and FRB restricted stock, other short-term 

investments, certain deposits (demand, interest checking, savings, 

money market and foreign office deposits), and federal funds 
purchased. Fair values for other time deposits, certificates of deposit 
$100,000 and over and other short-term borrowings were estimated 

using a discounted cash flow calculation that applied prevailing 

LIBOR/swap interest rates for the same maturities. 

 
Held-to-maturity securities 

The Bancorp™s held-to-maturity secu
rities are primarily composed of 
instruments that provide income tax credits as the economic return 
on the investment. The fair value of these instruments is estimated 
based on current U.S. Treasury tax credit rates. 

 
Loans held for sale 

Fair values for commercial loans held for sale were valued based on 

executable bids when available, or on
 discounted cash flow models incorporating appraisals of the un
derlying collateral, as well as 
assumptions about investor return requirements and amounts and 
timing of expected cash flows. Fair values for other consumer loans held for sale are based on contractual values upon which the loans 
may be sold to a third party, and approximate their carrying value. 
 
Portfolio loans and leases, net 

Fair values were estimated by di
scounting future cash flows using 
the current market rates of loans to borrowers with similar credit 

characteristics and similar remaining maturities.  Long-term debt 
Fair value of long-term debt was based on quoted market prices, 
when available, or a discounted cash flow calculation using 

LIBOR/swap interest rates and, in some cases, a spread for new 

issues for borrowings of similar terms. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
     Fifth Third Bancorp     145 
 28. CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL RATIOS The principal source of income and funds for the Bancorp (parent 
company) are dividends from its subsidiaries. The dividends paid by 
the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary 
are subject to regulations and limitations prescribed by the appropriate state and federal 
supervisory authorities. The Bancorp™s nonbank subsidiaries are also 

limited by certain federal and state statutory provisions and 

regulations covering the amount of
 dividends that may be paid in any given year. The Bancorp™s banking subsidiary must maintain cash reserve 
balances when total reservable deposit liabilities are greater than the 
regulatory exemption. These reserv
e requirements may be satisfied 
with vault cash and noninterest-
bearing cash balances on deposit 
with the FRB. In 2011 and 2010, the banking subsidiary was 
required to maintain average cash reserve balances of $744 million 

and $547 million, respectively.  
The FRB adopted guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding 

company and in analyzing applicati
ons to it under the Bank Holding 
Company Act of 1956, as amende
d. These guidelines include 
quantitative measures that assign ri
sk weightings to assets and off-
balance sheet items, as well as define and set minimum regulatory 

capital requirements. All bank holding companies are required to 

maintain Tier I capital (core capital) of at least four percent of risk-

weighted assets (Tier I capital ratio), total capital (Tier I plus Tier II 

capital) of at least eight percent of risk-weighted assets (Total risk-

based capital ratio), and Tier I capital of at least three percent of 
adjusted quarterly average assets (Tier I leverage ratio). Failure to 
meet the minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions 

by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the 

Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bancorp.   
Tier I capital consists princi
pally of shareholders™ equity including Tier I qualifying trust pr
eferred securities. It excludes 
unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and 
unrecognized pension actuarial gains and losses and prior service 
cost, goodwill, certain other intangibles and unrealized cash flow 
hedges. Current provisions of 
the Dodd-Frank Act will phase out 
the inclusion of certain trust preferred securities as a component of 

Tier I capital beginning January 1, 2013. Under these provisions, 

these trust preferred securities would qualify as a component of Tier 

II capital. At December 31, 2011, the Bancorp™s Tier I capital 

included $2.2 billion of trust preferred securities. 
Tier II capital consists principally of term subordinated debt, 
redeemable preferred stock and, subject to limitations, allowances 
for loan and lease losses.  
Assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet 
items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories, according 
to the obligor, guarantor or nature
 of collateral. The aggregate dollar 
value of the amount of each category
 is multiplied by the associated 
risk weighting of that category. The resulting weighted values from 
each of the risk categories in sum is the total risk-weighted assets. 
Quarterly average assets for this
 purpose do not include goodwill 
and any other intangible assets and other investments that the FRB determines should be deducted from Tier I capital.   
The supervisory agencies, including the Bancorp™s primary 
regulator, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, have issued 

regulations regarding the capital adequacy of banking subsidiaries. 

These requirements are substantially similar to those adopted by the 

FRB regarding bank holding companies, as described previously. In 

addition, the federal banking agencies have issued substantially 
similar regulations to implement the system of prompt corrective 
action established by Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Act. Under the regulations, a bank generally shall be deemed to be 

well-capitalized if it has a Total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or 

more, a Tier I capital ratio of six percent or more, a Tier I leverage 

ratio of five percent or more and is
 not subject to any written capital 
order or directive. If an institution becomes undercapitalized, it 
would become subject to significant additional oversight, regulations 
and requirements as mandated by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Act.  The Bancorp and its banking subsidiary, Fifth Third Bank (Ohio), had Tier I, Total risk-based capital and Tier I leverage ratios 

above the well-capitalized levels at December 31, 2011 and 2010. As 

of December 31, 2011, the most recent notification from the FRB 

categorized the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary as well-

capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective 
action. To continue to qualify for financial holding company status 
pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the Bancorp™s 

banking subsidiary must, among other things, maintain ﬁwell-

capitalizedﬂ capital ratios.

 30. BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Investment Advisors. Results of the Bancorp™s business segments are presented 

based on its management structure and management accounting 

practices. The structure and accounti
ng practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp™s business 

segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information 
for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its 

methodologies from time to time as management™s accounting 

practices are improved and businesses change. 
On June 30, 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of the 
processing business, which represented the sale of a majority 

interest in the Bancorp™s mer
chant acquiring and financial 
institutions processing businesses. Financial data for the merchant 
acquiring and financial institutions processing businesses was 

originally reported in the former Processing Solutions segment 

through June 30, 2009. As a result of the sale, the Bancorp no 

longer presents Processing Solutions as a segment and therefore, 
historical financial information 
for the merchant acquiring and 
financial institutions processing 
businesses has been reclassified 
under General Corporate and Other for all periods presented. 
Interchange revenue previously recorded in the Processing 

Solutions segment and associated with cards currently included in 

Branch Banking is now included in
 the Branch Banking segment for all periods presented. Additionally, the Bancorp retained its retail 

credit card and commercial multi-
card service businesses, which were also originally reported in the former Processing Solutions 

segment through June 30, 2009, and are included in the Branch 
Banking and Commercial Banking segments, respectively, for all 

periods presented. Revenue from the remaining ownership interest 

in the Processing Business is recorded in General Corporate and 

Other as noninterest income.
   The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level by employing a FTP methodology. This 
methodology insulates the business segments from interest rate 
volatility, enabling them to focus 
on serving customers through loan 
originations and deposit taking. The FTP system assigns charge 
rates and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, 

based on expected duration and th
e LIBOR swap curve. Matching 
duration allocates interest income and interest expense to each 

segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from 

interest rate risk. In a rising rate
 environment, the Bancorp benefits 
from the widening spread between deposit costs and wholesale 

funding costs. However, the Bancorp™s FTP system credits this 

benefit to deposit-providing businesses, such as Branch Banking 
and Investment Advisors, on a duration-adjusted basis. The net 

impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate 

and Other. The business segments are charged provision expense based on the actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans owned by each 
segment. Provision expense attribut
able to loan growth and changes 
in factors in the ALLL are captured in General Corporate and 
Other. The financial results of the business segments include 

allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Even 
with these allocations, the financial results are not necessarily 

indicative of the business segments™ financial condition and results 

of operations as if they existed as independent entities. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-
sell opportunities and when funding operations, by accessing the 
capital markets as a collective unit.  Results of operations and assets by segment for each of the 
three years ended December 31 are:

   PART I 
 ITEM 1.
BUSINESS 
General Information 
 The Bancorp, an Ohio corporation organized in 1975, is a bank 
holding company as defined by the Bank Holding Company Act 

of 1956, as amended (the ﬁBHCAﬂ), and is registered as such 

with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 

ﬁFRBﬂ). The Bancorp™s principal office is located in Cincinnati, 

Ohio.  The Bancorp™s subsidiaries provide a wide range of financial 
products and services to the retail, commercial, financial, 

governmental, educational and medical sectors, including a wide 

variety of checking, savings and money market accounts, and 

credit products such as credit cards, installment loans, mortgage 

loans and leases. Fifth Third Bank has deposit insurance provided 

by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) through the 

Deposit Insurance Fund. Refer to Exhibit 21 filed as an 

attachment to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of 
subsidiaries of the Bancorp as of December 31, 2011.  
The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues from the 
U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers 
domiciled in foreign countries is immaterial to the Bancorp™s 

Consolidated Financial Statements.  
Additional information regarding the Bancorp™s businesses is 
included in Management™s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 

Condition and Results of Operations.  
Competition  The Bancorp competes for deposits, loans and other banking 
services in its principal geographic markets as well as in selected 

national markets as opportunities arise. In addition to the 

challenge of attracting and retaining customers for traditional 

banking services, the Bancorp™s competitors include securities 
dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and 
insurance companies. These competitors, with focused products 

targeted at highly profitable customer segments, compete across 

geographic boundaries and provide customers increasing access 

to meaningful alternatives to banking services in nearly all 

significant products. The increasingly competitive environment is 

a result primarily of changes in regulation, changes in technology, 

product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of 

consolidation among financial service providers. These 

competitive trends are likely to continue.  
Acquisitions 
 The Bancorp™s strategy for growth includes strengthening its 
presence in core markets, expanding into contiguous markets and 

broadening its product offerings while taking into account the 

integration and other risks of growth. The Bancorp evaluates 
strategic acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence 
activities in connection with possi
ble transactions. As a result, 
discussions, and in some cases, negotiations may take place and 

future acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may 

occur. These typically involve the payment of a premium over 

book value and current market price, and therefore, some dilution 

of book value and net income per share may occur with any 

future transactions.  
Regulation and Supervision 
 In addition to the generally applicable state and federal laws 
governing businesses and employers, the Bancorp and its banking 

subsidiary are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state 

laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their 

parent companies. Virtually all aspects of the business of the 

Bancorp and its banking subsidiary are subject to specific 
requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight. The 
 154     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 principal objectives of state and federal banking laws and 
regulations and the supervision, regulation and examination of 

banks and their parent companies (such as the Bancorp) by bank 

regulatory agencies are the maintenance of the safety and 

soundness of financial institutions, maintenance of the federal 

deposit insurance system and the protection of consumers or 

classes of consumers, rather than the specific protection of 

shareholders of a bank or the parent company of a bank. To the 
extent the following material describes statutory or regulatory 
provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 

particular statute or regulation.  

 
Regulators  
The Bancorp and/or its banking subsidiary are subject to 

regulation and supervision primarily by the FRB, the Consumer 

Financial Protection Bureau (the ﬁCFPBﬂ) and the Ohio Division 

of Financial Institutions (the ﬁDivisionﬂ) and additionally by 

certain other functional regulators and self-regulatory 

organizations.   The Bancorp is also subject to regulation by the 

SEC by virtue of its status as a public company and due to the 

nature of some of its businesses.  The Bancorp™s banking 

subsidiary is subject to regulation by the FDIC, which insures the 

bank™s deposits as permitted by law.   
The federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable 
to banks and to some extent bank holding companies regulate, 

among other matters, the scope of their business, their activities, 

their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the 

availability of deposited funds, the amount of loans to individual 

and related borrowers and the nature, amount of and collateral for 

certain loans, and the amount of interest that may be charged on 

loans. Various federal and state consumer laws and regulations 

also affect the services provided to consumers.  
The Bancorp and/or its subsidiary are required to file various 
reports with, and is subject to examination by regulators, 

including the FRB and the Division. The FRB, Division and the 

CFPB have the authority to issue orders to bank holding 

companies and/or banks to cease and desist from certain banking 
practices and violations of conditions imposed by, or violations of 
agreements with, the FRB, Division and CFPB. Certain of the 

Bancorp™s and/or its banking subsidiary regulators are also 

empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies or 

individuals in certain situations, such as when there is a violation 

of a law or regulation. Applicable state and federal law also grant 

certain regulators the authority to impose additional requirements 

and restrictions on the activities of the Bancorp and or its banking 

subsidiary and, in some situations, the imposition of such 

additional requirements and restrictions will not be publicly 

available information.  

 
Acquisitions 

The BHCA requires the prior approval of the FRB, for a bank 

holding company to acquire substantially all the assets of a bank 
or to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 
5% of any class of the voting shares of any bank, bank holding 

company or savings association, or to increase any such non-

majority ownership or control of any bank, bank holding 

company or savings association, or to merge or consolidate with 

any bank holding company.  
The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company from 
acquiring a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than 

5% of any class of the voting shar
es of a company that is not a 
bank or a bank holding company and from engaging directly or 

indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or 

controlling banks or furnishing services to its banking 

subsidiaries, except that it may engage in and may own shares of 
companies engaged in certain activities the FRB has determined 

to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling 

banks as to be proper incident thereto. 

 
Financial Holding Companies  

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (ﬁGLBAﬂ) permits a 

qualifying bank holding company to become a financial holding 

company (ﬁFHCﬂ) and thereby to engage directly or indirectly in 
a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank 
holding company under the BHCA. Permitted activities for a 

FHC include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance 

underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking and other 

activities that are declared by the FRB, in cooperation with the 

Treasury Department, to be ﬁfinancial in nature or incidental 

theretoﬂ or are declared by the FRB unilaterally to be 

ﬁcomplementaryﬂ to financial activities. In addition, a FHC is 

allowed to conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire 

permissible non-bank financial companies with after-the-fact 

notice to the FRB. A bank holding company may elect to become 

a FHC if each of its banking subsidiaries is well capitalized, is 

well managed and has at least a ﬁSatisfactoryﬂ rating under the 

Community Reinvestment Act (ﬁCRAﬂ). Dodd-Frank also 

extended the well capitalized and well managed requirement to 
the bank holding company. In 2000, the Bancorp elected and 
qualified for FHC status under the GLBA. To maintain FHC 

status, a holding company must continue to meet certain 

requirements. The failure to meet such requirements could result 

in restrictions on the activities of
 the FHC or loss of FHC status. 
If restrictions are imposed on the activities of an FHC, such 

information may not necessarily be available to the public.  

 
Dividends 

The Bancorp depends in part upon dividends received from its 

direct and indirect subsidiaries, including its indirect banking 

subsidiary, to fund its activities, including the payment of 

dividends. The Bancorp and its banking subsidiary are subject to 

various federal and state restrictions on their ability to pay 
dividends. The FRB has authority to prohibit bank holding 
companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to 

be an unsafe or unsound practice. The FRB has indicated 

generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank 

holding companies to pay dividends unless a bank holding 

company™s net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the 

expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the 

organization™s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial 

condition. The ability to pay dividends may be further limited by 

provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and implanting regulations (see 

the ﬁRegulatory Reformﬂ section.   

 
Source of Strength 

Under long-standing FRB policy and now as codified in the 

Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company is expected to act as a 
source of financial and managerial strength to each of its banking 
subsidiaries and to commit resources to their support.  This 

support may be required at times when the bank holding company 

may not have the resources to provide it.   
 FDIC Assessments  

As contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act the FDIC has revised the 

framework by which insured depository institutions with more 

than $10 billion in assets (ﬁlarg
e IDIsﬂ) are assessed for purposes 
of payments to the Deposit Insurance Fund (the ﬁDIFﬂ). The final 

rule implementing revisions to the assessment system was 

released on February 7, 2011, and took effect for the quarter 

beginning April 1, 2011.  
`      Fifth Third Bancorp     155 
 Prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, a large IDI™s 
DIF premiums principally were based on the size of an IDI™s 
domestic deposit base. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the 

assessment base from a large IDI™s 
domestic deposit base to its 
total assets less tangible equity. In addition to potentially greatly 

increasing the size of a large IDI™s assessment base, the expansion 
of the assessment base affords the FDIC much greater flexibility 
to vary its assessment system based upon the different asset 

classes that large IDIs normally hold on their balance sheets.  
To implement this provision, the FDIC created an 
assessment scheme vastly different from the deposit-based 

system. Under the new system, large IDIs are assessed under a 

complex ﬁscorecardﬂ methodology that seeks to capture both the 

probability that an individual large IDI will fail and the 

magnitude of the impact on the DIF if such a failure occurs.  

 
Transactions with Affiliates 

Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, restrict 

transactions between a bank and its affiliates (as defined in 

Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act), including a 

parent bank holding company. The Bancorp™s banking subsidiary 
is subject to certain restrictions, including but not limited to 
restrictions on loans to its affiliates, on investments in the stock or 

securities thereof, on the taking of such stock or securities as 

collateral for loans to any borro
wer, and on the issuance of a 
guarantee or letter of credit on their behalf. Among other things, 

these restrictions limit the amount of such transactions, require 

collateral in prescribed amounts for extensions of credit, prohibit 

the purchase of low quality assets and require that the terms of 

such transactions be substantially equivalent to terms of 

comparable transactions with non-affiliates. Generally, the 

Bancorp™s banking subsidiary is limited in its extension of credit 

to any affiliate to 10% of the banking subsidiary™s capital stock 

and surplus and its extension of credit to all affiliates to 20% of 

the banking subsidiary™s capital stock and surplus.  

 Community Reinvestment Act
  The CRA generally requires insured depository institutions to 
identify the communities they serve and to make loans and 

investments and provide services that meet the credit needs of 

those communities. Furthermore, the CRA requires the FRB to 

evaluate the performance of the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary in 

helping to meet the credit needs of its communities. As a part of 

the CRA program, the banking subsidiary is subject to periodic 

examinations by the FRB, and must maintain comprehensive 

records of their CRA activities for this purpose. During these 

examinations, the FRB rates such institutions™ compliance with 

CRA as ﬁOutstanding,ﬂ ﬁSatisf
actory,ﬂ ﬁNeeds to Improveﬂ or 
ﬁSubstantial Noncompliance.ﬂ Failure of an institution to receive 

at least a ﬁSatisfactoryﬂ rating could inhibit such institution or its 

holding company from undertaking certain activities, including 
engaging in activities permitted as a financial holding company 
under the GLBA and acquiring other financial institutions. The 

FRB must take into account the record of performance of banks in 

meeting the credit needs of the entire community served, 

including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Fifth Third 

Bank received a ﬁSatisfactoryﬂ CRA rating in its most recent 

CRA examination.  

 
Capital  
The FRB has established capital guidelines for bank holding 

companies and FHCs. The FRB, the Division and the FDIC have 

also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for 

banks. Failure to meet capital requirements could subject the 

Bancorp and its banking subsidiary to a variety of restrictions and 
enforcement actions. In addition, as discussed previously, the 

Bancorp and its banking subsidiary must remain well capitalized 

and well managed for the Bancorp to retain its status as a FHC. 

See the ﬁRegulatory Reformﬂ section for additional information 

on capital requirements impacting the Bancorp. 

 Privacy  The FRB, FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted 

final guidelines (the ﬁGuidelines) for safeguarding confidential, 

personal customer information. The Guidelines require each 

financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight 

of its Board of Directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to 

create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written 

information security program designed to ensure the security and 

confidentiality of customer information, protect against any 

anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such 

information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of 

such information that could result in substantial harm or 

inconvenience to any customer. The Bancorp has adopted a 

customer information security program that has been approved by 

the Bancorp™s Board of Directors (the ﬁBoard).  
The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement 
policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic 

personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third 

parties. In general, the statute requires explanations to consumers 

on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such 

nonpublic personal information, and, except as otherwise required 

by law, prohibits disclosing such information except as provided 

in the banking subsidiary™s policies and procedures. The 

Bancorp™s banking subsidiary has implemented a privacy policy.  

 
Anti-Money Laundering 

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing 

Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism 

Act of 2001 (the ﬁPatriot Actﬂ), designed to deny terrorists and 

others the ability to obtain access to the United States financial 
system, has significant implications for depository institutions, 
brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of 

money. The Patriot Act, as implemented by various federal 

regulatory agencies, requires financial institutions, including the 

Bancorp and its subsidiaries, to implement new policies and 

procedures or amend existing policies and procedures with 

respect to, among other matters, anti-money laundering, 

compliance, suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting 

and due diligence on customers. The Patriot Act and its 

underlying regulations also permit information sharing for 

counter-terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement 

agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial 

institutions, subject to certain conditions, and require the FRB 

(and other federal banking agencies) to evaluate the effectiveness 

of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when 
considering applications filed under Section 3 of the BHCA or the 
Bank Merger Act. The Bancorp™s Board has approved policies 

and procedures that are believed to be compliant with the Patriot 

Act.  
 
Exempt Brokerage Activities 

The GLBA amended the federal securities laws to eliminate the 

blanket exceptions that banks traditionally have had from the 

definition of ﬁbrokerﬂ and ﬁdealer.ﬂ The GLBA also required that 

there be certain transactiona
l activities that would not be 
ﬁbrokerageﬂ activities, which banks could effect without having 

to register as a broker. In September 2007, the FRB and SEC 

approved Regulation R to govern bank securities activities. 

Various exemptions permit banks to conduct activities that would 
 156     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 otherwise constitute brokerage activ
ities under the securities laws. 
Those exemptions include conducting brokerage activities related 
to trust, fiduciary and similar se
rvices, certain services and also 
conducting a de minimis number of riskless principal 

transactions, certain asset-backed transactions and certain 

securities lending transactions. The Bancorp only conducts non-

exempt brokerage activities through its affiliated registered 

broker-dealer.   Emergency Economic Stabilization  
On October 3, 2008, in response to the stresses experienced in the 
financial markets, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act 

(ﬁEESAﬂ) was enacted. EESA authorizes the Secretary of the 

Treasury to purchase up to $700 billion in troubled assets from 

financial institutions under the Troubled Asset Relief Program or 

TARP. Troubled assets include residential or commercial 

mortgages and related instruments originated prior to March 14, 

2008 and any other financial instrument that the Secretary 

determines, after consultation with
 the Chairman of the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the purchase of which 

is necessary to promote financial stability. 
  
Capital Purchase Program 
Pursuant to its authority under EESA, Treasury created the TARP 
Capital Purchase Program (ﬁCPPﬂ) under which the Treasury 

Department was authorized to invest up to $250 billion in senior 

preferred stock of U.S. banks a
nd savings associations or their 
holding companies. Qualifying financial institutions could issue 

senior preferred stock with a value equal to not less than 1% of 

risk-weighted assets and not more than the lesser of $25 billion or 

3% of risk-weighted assets.   
In connection with the issuance of the senior preferred, 
participating institutions were required to issue to Treasury 

immediately exercisable 10-year warrants to purchase common 

stock with an aggregate market price equal to 15% of the amount 

of senior preferred.  
On December 31, 2008, the Bancorp entered into a Letter 
Agreement (including the Secu
rities Purchase AgreementŠ
Standard Terms incorporated by reference therein, the ﬁPurchase 

Agreement) with Treasury pursuant to which the Company issued 

and sold to Treasury for an aggregate purchase price of 

approximately $3.4 billion in cash: (i) 136,320 shares of the 

Bancorp™s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, 

Series F, having a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (the 

ﬁSeries F Preferred Stock), and (ii) a ten-year warrant to purchase 

up to 43,617,747 shares of the Bancorp™s common stock, no par 

value per share, at an initial exercise price of $11.72 per share.  
 In the Purchase Agreement, the Bancorp agreed that, until 
such time as Treasury ceases to own any debt or equity securities 

of the Bancorp acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the 

Bancorp would take all necessary action to ensure that its benefit 

plans with respect to its senior executive officers comply with 
Section 111(b) of EESA as implemented by any guidance or 
regulation under the EESA that had been issued and was in effect 

as of the date of issuance of the Series F Preferred Stock and the 

Warrant, and agreed to not adopt any benefit plans with respect 

to, or which covers, its senior executive officers that do not 

comply with the EESA.  
On February 2, 2011 the Bancorp repurchased the Series F 
Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to TARP.  

On March 16, 2011, the Bancorp repurchased the warrant issued 

to the U.S. Treasury.
  
 
 Regulatory Reform 
 On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-

Frank Act, which is aimed, in part, at accountability and 

transparency in the financial system and includes numerous 

provisions that apply to and/or could impact the Bancorp and its 

banking subsidiary. The Dodd-Frank Act implements changes 

that, among other things, affect the oversight and supervision of 

financial institutions, provide for a new resolution procedure for 
large financial companies, create a new agency responsible for 
implementing and enforcing compliance with consumer financial 

laws, introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements, 

effect significant changes in the regulation of over the counter 

derivatives, reform the regulation of credit rating agencies, 

implement changes to corporate governance and executive 

compensation practices, incorporate requirements on proprietary 

trading and investing in certain funds by financial institutions 

(known as the ﬁVolcker Ruleﬂ), require registration of advisers to 

certain private funds, and effect significant changes in the 

securitization market.  In order to fully implement many 

provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, various government agencies, 

in particular banking and other financial services agencies are 

required to promulgate regulations. Set forth below is a 

discussion of some of the major sections the Dodd-Frank Act and 
implementing regulations that have or could have a substantial 
impact on the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary. Due to the 

volume of regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Act, not all 

proposed or final regulations that may have an impact on the 

Bancorp or its banking subsidiary are necessarily discussed.  

 
Financial Stability Oversight Council  

The Dodd-Frank Act creates the Financial Stability Oversight 

Council (ﬁFSOCﬂ), which is chaired by the Secretary of the 

Treasury and composed of expertise from various financial 

services regulators. The FSOC has 
responsibility for identifying 
risks and responding to emerging threats to financial stability. On 

December 29, 2011, a rule was proposed (with a sixty-day 

comment period) to assess a fee on large banks and financial 
institutions to cover the expenses of the Office of Financial 
Research and FSOC. The fees would also cover certain expenses 

incurred by the FDIC. Under the proposal, bank holding 

companies with at least $50 billion in assets and foreign banks 

with at least $50 billion in assets in the U.S. would be assessed a 

semiannual fee, the size of which has yet to be determined.  

 
Executive Compensation 
 The Dodd-Frank Act provides for a say on pay for shareholders of 

all public companies. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, each company 

must give its shareholders the opportunity to vote on the 

compensation of its executives at least once every three years. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also adds disclosure and voting 

requirements for golden parachute compensation that is payable 

to named executive officers in connection with sale transactions.  
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to issue rules 
directing the stock exchanges to prohibit listing classes of equity 

securities if a company™s compensation committee members are 

not independent. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides that a 

company™s compensation committee may only select a 

compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor after 

taking into consideration factors to be identified by the SEC that 

affect the independence of a compensation consultant, legal 

counsel or other advisor.  The SEC is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to issue rules 
obligating companies to disclose in proxy materials for annual 

meetings of shareholders information that shows the relationship 

between executive compensation actually paid to their named 
`      Fifth Third Bancorp     157 
 executive officers and their financial performance, taking into 
account any change in the value of the shares of a company™s 

stock and dividends or distributions.  
The Dodd-Frank Act provides that the SEC must issue rules 
directing the stock exchanges to prohibit listing any security of a 

company unless the company develops and implements a policy 
providing for disclosure of the policy of the company on 
incentive-based compensation that is based on financial 

information required to be reported under the securities laws and 

that, in the event the company is required to prepare an 

accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the 

company with any financial reporting requirement under the 

securities laws, the company will recover from any current or 

former executive officer of the company who received incentive-

based compensation during the three-year period preceding the 

date on which the company is required to prepare the restatement 

based on the erroneous data, any exceptional compensation above 

what would have been paid under the restatement.  
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC, by rule, to require 
that each company disclose in the proxy materials for its annual 

meetings whether an employee or board member is permitted to 
purchase financial instruments designed to hedge or offset 
decreases in the market value of equity securities granted as 

compensation or otherwise held by the employee or board 

member.  
Corporate Governance 
 The Dodd-Frank Act clarifies that the SEC may, but is not 
required to promulgate rules that would require that a company™s 

proxy materials include a nominee for the board of directors 

submitted by a shareholder. Although the SEC promulgated rules 

to accomplish this, these rules were invalidated by a federal 

appeals court decision.  The SEC has said that they will not 

challenge the ruling, but has not ruled out the possibility that new 

rules could be proposed. 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires stock exchanges to have rules 
prohibiting their members from voting securities that they do not 

beneficially own (unless they have received voting instructions 

from the beneficial owner) with respect to the election of a 
member of the board of directors (other than an uncontested 
election of directors of an investment company registered under 

the Investment Company Act of 1940), executive compensation 

or any other significant matter, as determined by the SEC by rule.  

 
Credit Ratings  

The Dodd-Frank Act includes a number of provisions that are 

targeted at improving the reliability of credit ratings. The SEC has 

been charged with adopting various rules in this regard.  
Consumer Issues 
 The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new bureau, the CFPB, which has 
the authority to implement regulations pursuant to numerous 

consumer protection laws and has supervisory authority, 

including the power to conduct examination and take enforcement 

actions, with respect to depository institutions with more than $10 

billion in consolidated assets. The CFPB also has authority, with 

respect to consumer financial services to, among other things, 
restrict unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, enforce laws 
that prohibit discrimination and unfair treatment and to require 

certain consumer disclosures.  

 
Debit Card Interchange Fees 
 The Dodd-Frank Act provides for a set of new rules requiring that 

interchange transaction fees for electric debit transactions be 

ﬁreasonableﬂ and proportional to certain costs associated with 

processing the transactions. The FRB was given authority to, 
among other things, establish standards for assessing whether 

interchange fees are reasonable and proportional. In June 2011, 

the FRB issued a final rule establishing certain standards and 

prohibitions pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, including 

establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and 

allowing for an upward adjustment if the issuer develops and 
implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to 
prevent fraud.  The provisions regarding debit card interchange 

fees and the fraud adjustment became effective October 1, 2011.   

The rules impose requirements on the Bancorp and its banking 

subsidiary and may negatively impact our revenues and results of 

operations. 

 FDIC Matters and Resolution Planning
 The Dodd-Frank Act creates an orderly liquidation process that 
the FDIC can employ for failing financial companies that are not 

insured depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the 

FDIC new authority to create a widely available emergency 

financial stabilization program to guarantee the obligations of 

solvent depository institutions and their holding companies and 

affiliates during times of severe economic stress. Additionally, 

Dodd-Frank also codifies many of the temporary changes that had 

already been implemented, such as permanently increasing the 

amount of deposit insurance to $250,000.  
In September 2011, the FDIC approved an interim final rule 
that requires an insured depository institution with $50 billion or 

more in total assets to submit periodic contingency plans to the 

FDIC for resolution in the event of the institution™s failure.  The 

rule became effective in January 2012, however, submission of 

plans will be staggered over a period of time.  The Bancorp™s 

banking subsidiary is subject to this rule.  
In October 2011, the FRB issued a final rule implementing 
resolution planning requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act.  The 

final rule requires bank holding companies with assets of $50 

billion or more and nonbank financial firms designated by FSOC 

for supervision by the FRB to annually submit resolution plans to 

the FDIC and FRB.  Each plan shall describe the company™s 

strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy during 
times of financial distress.   Under the final rule, companies will 
submit their initial resolution plans on a staggered basis.  The 

Bancorp will be required to submit a resolution plan pursuant to 

this rule.  
 
Proprietary Trading and Investing in Certain Funds 

The Dodd-Frank Act sets forth new restrictions on banking 

organizations™ ability to engage in proprietary trading and 

sponsorship of or investment in private equity and hedge funds 

(the ﬁVolcker ruleﬂ). The scope of the new restrictions will be 

more clear upon adoption of final regulations promulgated under 

the Volcker rule, however the Volker Rule also generally 

prohibits any banking entity from sponsoring or acquiring any 

ownership interest in a private equity or hedge fund.  The Volker 

rule, however, contains a number of exceptions, which exceptions 
will be clarified upon promulgation of final rules adopted on an 
interagency basis.  The Volker rule permits transactions in the 

securities of the U.S. government and its agencies, certain 

government-sponsored enterprises and states and their political 

subdivisions, as well as certain investments in small business 

investment companies.  Transactions on behalf of customers and 

in connection with certain underwriting and market making 

activities, as well as risk-mitiga
ting hedging activities and certain 
foreign banking activities are also permitted.  
De minimus ownership of private equity or hedge funds will also be permitted 

under final regulations as well.  In addition to the general 

prohibition on sponsorship and investment, the Volker rule 
 158     Fifth Third Bancorp 
 contains additional requirements applicable to any private equity 
or hedge fund that is sponsored by the banking entity or for which 

it serves as investment manager or investment advisor.  The 

Bancorp will be required to demonstrate that it has a satisfactory 

compliance programs specifically to monitor compliance with the 

Volcker rule.   
Derivatives  
The Dodd-Frank Act includes measures to broaden the scope of 
derivative instruments subject to regulation by requiring clearing 

and exchange trading of certain derivatives, imposing new capital 

and margin requirements for certa
in market participants and 
imposing position limits on certain over-the-counter derivatives.  

To the extent that the Bancorp acts in certain capacities in trading 

derivatives or trades a certain amount of certain derivatives 

instruments, then certain affiliates of the Bancorp may be 

required to register with the Commodity Futures Trading 

Commission or the SEC.  As with the Volcker Rule, the Bancorp 

will be required to demonstrate that it has a satisfactory 

compliance program to monitor the activities of any swap dealer 

or major swap participant registered under the new regulations. 

The ultimate impact of these derivatives regulations, and the time 

it will take to comply, continues to remain uncertain. The final 
regulations will impose additional operational and compliance 
costs on us and may require us to restructure certain businesses 

and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. 
Interstate Bank Branching 
 The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions permitting national and 
insured state banks to engage in 
de novo
 interstate branching if, 
under the laws of the state where the new branch is to be 

established, as state bank chartered in that state would be 

permitted to establish a branch.  
Systemically Significant Companies and Capital
 The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new regulatory regime for entities 
that are deemed to be ﬁsystemically significant financial 

companies.ﬂ The Dodd-Frank Act sets a $50 billion consolidated 

asset floor for a bank holding company to be subject to the 

heightened oversight and regulation, although the FRB can adjust 

those amounts upward for some of the heightened standards under 

certain circumstances. Dodd-Frank establishes a broad framework 
for identifying, applying heightened supervision and regulation 
to, and (as necessary) limiting the size and activities of 

systemically significant financial companies.  
The Dodd-Frank Act instructs the FRB to impose enhanced 
capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms 

and mandates the Federal Reserve to conduct annual stress tests 

on all bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in assets 

to determine whether they have the capital needed to absorb 

losses in baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic 

conditions.  In November 2011, the FRB adopted final rules 

requiring bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in 

consolidated assets to submit capital plans to the FRB on an 

annual basis.  Under the final rules, the FRB annually will 

evaluate an institutions capital adequacy, internal capital 

adequacy, assessment processes and plans to make capital 
distributions such as dividend payments and stock repurchases.   
Also in November 2011, the FRB launched the 2012 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (ﬁCCARﬂ), which 
required certain large organizations, such as the Bancorp, to 

submit capital plans by January 9, 2012.  As part of the CCAR, 

the FRB will also carry out a supervisory stress test.  An 

organization™s capital adequacy and its plans to make capital 

distributions will be assessed against a number of criteria, 

including projected performance under stress scenarios. 
In December 2011, the FRB issued proposed rules to 
strengthen regulation and supervision of large bank holding 

companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms.  

The proposed rules would generally apply to all US bank holding 

companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such 

as the Bancorp, and any nonbank financial firms that may be 

designated by the FSOC as systemically important companies.  

The proposal, which is mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, 
includes a wide range of measur
es addressing such issues as 
capital, liquidity, credit exposure, stress testing, risk management 
and early remediation requirements.  In particular, the proposal 

includes proposed risk-based capital and leverage requirements 

that would be implemented in two phases, the first phase would 

be subject to the FRB™s capital plan rule issued in November 

2011.  The second phase would involve the FRB issuing a 

proposal to implement a risk-based capital surcharge based on the 

framework and methodology developed by the Basel Committee 

on Banking Supervision (the ﬁBasel Committeeﬂ), the current 

version referred to as ﬁBasel III.ﬂ    
Basel III is designed to materi
ally improve the quality of 
regulatory capital and introduces a new minimum common equity 

requirement. Basel III also raises
 the numerical minimum capital 
requirements and introduces capital conservation and 
countercyclical buffers to induce banking organizations to hold 
capital in excess of regulatory minimums. In addition, Basel III 

establishes an international leverage standard for internationally 

active banks. The FRB is working with other U.S. banking 

regulators to implement the Basel 
III capital reforms in the United 
States.  It is not anticipated that such implementing rules would 

be issued until 2013 or 2014 and there would most likely be a 

phase-in period.
