Dear Fifth Third Shareholders,
If you have banked with us lately, you may have noticed 
that somethinerent’s because atd, 

we have been changing the way we do business. 
We are repositioning the Company for a new age in banking. 

In today’s world, this isn’t a simple task, nor is it singular in 

iects. It touches every part of our Company.
We are doing important work to enhance our culture and 
our reputation as a well-run institution, one that provides 

valuable solutions for our customers while appropriately 

balancing risk and reward. We are continuing oorts 

to achieve the right business mix – one that produces 

less volatile, more sustainable earnings growth – while 

providing a good return for our investors and great 

opportunities for our employees. Finding the right mix is 

as much about the opportunities we pursue as it is about 

the activities from which we choose to refrain. And, we 

will continue to simplify the business in every way we 

can by taking complexity out of processes and systems 

and focusing on hiring and retaining strong talent. As we 

think about the future of our Company in this context, we 

continue to pursue our four main strategies: 
distinctive 
execution
, focused segmentation
, innovation
, and 
accelerating growth
. Across all of our businesses, we are 
doing exceptional work.
As we make our plans, we are closely attuned to the cyclical 
nature of interest rates and the impact of external forces 

on our industry. Competition from banks and non-banks 

is intense. Evolving consumer behavior and technology 

are challenging the status quo. Although the economy has 

shown modest signs of improvement, progress has been 

uneven and the low interest rate environment remains 

a headwind. Heightened regulatory and supervisory 

expectations continue to create substantial uncertainty, 

although sont areas of regulation, like capital 

and liquidity requirements, are coming into focus. It’s clear 

toealities of the near-to-medium term climate for 

thncial services industry make the case for change.
ncial performance demonstrated our 
ability toectively address those things and, equally 
ectively, execute on our business plans. Our results in 
the years ahead will rt the repositioning that is already 
underway and our objectives to drive outperformance and 
positiveerentiation from our peerectations – 

from our customers, our investors, our employees, and our 

regulators – are that we continue to pursue operational 

excellence and successfully mitigate all categories of

risk while also anticipating and managing change in our 
business. We are well along the path. 
2014 net income available to common shareholders was 
$1.4 billion and earnings per diluted share were $1.66. 

Results included solid performance across our business 

lines highlighted by growth in corporate banking, 

payments processing, and investment advisory revenue. 

ntributed to a return on average assets of 1.1 

percent, which is above the average of our commercial 

bank peers, and return on average tangible common 

equity* of 12.2 percent. It takes focused execution to 

deliver on the promise of creating long-term value, and the 

solid returns that we produced provide a good barometer 

for our progress. Our persistent focus on the things we can 

control and our day-to-day execution on the fundamentals 

were evident as we strengthened the balance sheet, grew 

net interest income, reduced expenses, and saw continued 

improvement in credit metrics throughout the year. 
Our results have been supplemented by gains on our 
position in the payment processing company, Vantiv, Inc. 
2014 PERFORMANCEFull year 2014 net income available to common 
shareholders of $1.4 billion decreased 21 percent from 
2013. Earnings per diluted common share of $1.66 
decreased 17 percent. 
Results for both years included the beneﬁt of earnings 
related to our holding in Vantiv. In 2014, after-tax 
Vantiv net gains were approximately $148 million 
(approximately $0.17 per share), compared with  
net gains of $403 million (approximately $0.45 per 
share) in 2013. Excluding Vantiv-related items, diluted 
earnings per share declined 5 percent year-over-year, 
driven by lower motgage banking net revenue.
Our balance sheet is strong as we maintained our 
cautious approach to lending and scaled back in 
areas that we don’t believe have a compelling risk/
return proﬁle. Average loans and leases increased to 
$91.1 billion, with 9 percent growth in commercial and 
industrial loans. 
We also continued to grow high-value, low-cost 
transaction deposits in 2014, with average balances 
increasing 8 percent from 2013. We view the strength 
of our deposit franchise to be the driving force for 
proﬁtable balance sheet growth in the coming years.
In a year with continued pressure on margins, we grew 
net interest income 1 percent. We took advantage of rate 
opportunities throughout the year to add to and change 
the composition of our securities portfolio in order  
to improve our liquidity position. At year-end, we

3estimated Fifth Third’s liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
to be above 110 percent, which currently compares 
favorably with many similarly-sized banks and positions 
us to be compliant with the Federal Banking Regulators’ 
LCR requirements.
Noninterest income decreased 23 percent from 2013, 
reﬂecting the lower net beneﬁt from our investment in 
Vantiv and a 56 percent decline in mortgage banking net 
revenue. Otherwise, fee income results were highlighted 
by corporate banking revenue and categories that 
exhibit less volatility like card and processing revenue, 
investment advisory fees, and service charges on 
deposits. Our focus on expense management was evident and 
represents another cornerstone of our strategy to 
achieve our return targets. Total noninterest expense 
declined 6 percent from 2013 despite a 4 percent 
increase in technology and communications expense as 
we continue to invest in our businesses.
Credit trends reﬂected our continued de-risking of the 
business. Full year net charge-offs increased 15 percent 
while nonperforming assets declined 24 percent from 
2013. We reduced our loan loss reserves by $260 million; 
although our coverage ratios remain solid at 1.47 percent 
of loans and 228 percent of nonperforming loans.
Overall, we have good momentum in many of our core 
businesses and believe we are taking appropriate steps 
to position ourselves for long-term success.
roven to be a strategic advantage for us as we have 
recognized approximately $3.2 billion in total pre-tax gains 

from our sale of the processing business in 2009 to today, 

including net gains of $227 million in 2014. We currently 

own a 22.8 percent interest in Vantiv, whose market 

capitalization was $5.8 billion at year-end.d has 

beted tremendously from its investment in Vantiv, and 

while we would expect to manage our position downward 

over time in a disciplined way, it continues to give us 

nt capitility.
We increased our annual common dividend 9 percent from 
2013, to a level consistent with the Federal Reserve’s near-

term dividend payout ratio guidance of 30 percent. Including 

common stock repurchases, we returned $1.1 billion to 

shareholders. We have reduced our share count by 4 percent 

from year-end 2013 and grew tangible book value per share 

by 11 percent. Despite these returns, our capital levels remain 

very strong overall, with a Tier 1 common equity ratio* of 

9.7 percent, up 20 basis points, and 9.4 percent as estimated 

pro forma under the Basel III requirements.

CONSUMER LENDING
We know that consumers value the security of accessing credit when needed. Across our 
Consumer Lending solutions, we offer competitive rates with ﬂexible terms in order to help 
customers reach their goals, whether short- or long-term. 
In our consumer credit card business, our focus remains on acquiring and activating existing 
retail and small business customers to strengthen the total customer relationship. To fuel 
continued growth in this business, we successfully launched a new rewards platform in 
2014, we dramatically increased Access 360° sales through improved customer features and 
beneﬁts, and we continue to improve the features of our core credit card product offerings. 
We are committed to developing new, customer-focused solutions, which will be further 
accelerated by the creation of our new Payments and Commerce Solutions division.
Our auto business is another source of strength as it tends to be a high-quality, attractive 
asset class. Our long-standing presence in this market has allowed us to develop strong 

relationships with dealers across our 45-state indirect auto footprint. We are the sixth-
largest bank originator of indirect auto loans in the country.
Our mortgage business is the most cyclical of our businesses and we have managed well 
through the most recent cycle. We have a fairly ﬂexible business model that can be adjusted 
quickly in response to the changing environment. We are currently focused on winning in 
the purchase mortgage market and growing through direct, relationship-oriented channels.
Across our lending solutions, we provide ample resources to simplify the process of 
obtaining a loan and we proactively work with borrowers to explore options that make 
sense within their current ﬁnancial situation. It is important for us to be trusted and valued 
over the life of the loans we make and for many years beyond.

In light of our results, we are disappointed that our one-
year total shareholder return (stock price plus dividends) 

was negative 0.7 percent in 2014. Given the positive 

momentum and outperformance we have seen over the 

past several years, we are not sath this outcome. 

Looking out over a longer-term horizod’ve-

year total shareholder return was 129.7 percent, which 

outperformed both the S&P commercial banks index and 

the S&P 500 index. As stewards of your capital, we believe 

that we are positioning the Bank for stronger performance 

than our one-year total return would suggest and we 

are aligned with our shareholders in the desire to regain 
positive momentum when it comes to our valuation. We 
have reason to hope that as the market looks forward, we 

will be rewarded for the actions we are taking to proactively 

transform the Company for sustainable excellence and 

competitive advantage in the years ahead. 
Being proactive oen means making tough decisions. In 
2014, we took several steps to enhance our risk culture, 

une our business mix, and reduce the complexity of 

our operations, identifying ways to best use our strengths 

while decreasing our dependency in areas where we face 

risks or add limited value. We determined that certain

5activities fell outside of our current risk parameters and 
were willing to sacrar-term earnings for long-

term growth and a less volatile, more consistent earnings 

stream over time. For example, in March, we decided 

to exit the broker mortgage business given regulatory 

concerns and the prevailing market environment at the 

timeusiness generated a little more than 30 percent 

of our mortgage originations in 2013; while itult 

to walk away from that kind of contribution, this decision 

strengthens our controls and simpur operations in 

mortgage lending. Another de
cision we made was to end 
enrollment of new customers and make changes to the 
structure for existing customers in our deposit advance 
product. We believe there is a need for a short-term, small-

dollar credit product within the banking industry and 

we continue to proactively engage with key stakeholders 

to review alternative solutions. We are also taking a 

measured approach to lending. We are scaling back in 

areas that we don’t believe have a compelling risk/return 

prole, like certain segments of commercial lending, and 

we have maintained our disciplined pricing methodology 

in indirect auto lending. 
Even as we scaled back, we increased portfolio loan 
balances to $90.1 billion, up 2 percent from 2013, with 4 
BRANCH BANKINGA strong Retail Bank is critical to our future. Consumer banking  
continues to go through signiﬁcant transformations. Some of our  
changes thus far have been due to strategies we had planned and 
executed, especially those geared toward providing consultative 
and differentiated service. Others were driven by evolving consumer 
behavior and our desire to offer our customers options in line with their 
preferences. Amidst all of the changes, our afﬁliate model continues 
to provide a competitive advantage for us. Our local teams are able to 

connect with the unique and diverse areas of our footprint to create a 
more personal banking experience. 
While our banking centers represent the physical manifestation of our 
brand in the community, our enhanced online and mobile presence is 
becoming an increasingly valued tool for our customers. We will continue 

to integrate our delivery channels to bring a consistent experience that 
drives efﬁciencies and revenue opportunities for the Bank. 
We are focused on reducing reliance on the aspects of consumer banking 
that are exposed to regulation or which present return challenges. We 
will beneﬁt from the integrated, multi-channel delivery model that we 
made enhancements to throughout this past year. Likewise, our focused 
segmentation strategy is helping us to deliver new value propositions 
with a fair-value exchange as we continue to emphasize the importance 
of our relationship-banking orientation.

deposits and to develop deeper customer relationships.
In our Consumer Bank, we are providinerentiated 
customer experience with clear value propositions through 

outstanding, consistent delive
ry. Our willingness to take 
a thoughtful approach and to actively test and evaluate 

erent tactics will lead to the best solutions foh 

d and our customers. We continue to redesign our 
distribution network to better match our delivery options 
with consumer demand. Mobile and ATM deposits now 
account for more than one-third of our consumer deposit 

transactions, a result that has corresponded with a decline 

in teller transactions. As we optimize our distribution 

network, we have become moret by rethinking the 

role of branches, upgrading our ATM network, and making 

enhancements to our digital delivery. 
Our banking centers, especially in today’s competitive 
deposit environment, provide valuable touch points with 

customers. We are addressing branchy primarily 

through recalibrating our branch sta. Most impactful to 

theen our new “universal banker” role, which 

combines personal banking and customer service skills. 

We are also testing a smaller branch format that has lower 

stang requirements compared with traditional full-

service branches, and we are exploring alternative coverage 

models where we could operate multiple branches with the 

same management team. Our branches are complemented 

by our network of 2,638 ATMs, all of which are now entirely 

image-enabled. In select locations, we deployed ATMs with 

additional consumer-friendly upgrades. We also rolled out 

a number of new services geared to improve the mobile 

customer experiencet popular new feature, Now 

Balance, allows customers to access their account balances 

without logging in to mobile banking.
Banking is a relationship business and we align our teams 
to place the customer in the center of every discussion. 

As we work with our customers, we use innovation to 

create solutions that drive shared value. Whether we 

are improving products and services, sharpening the 

technology used to deliver them, or utilizing a more 

consultative sales technique, we are moving forward to 

create value in the industry. 
d Bank is an integral part of our communities 
and our customers’ lives, so we feel compelled to help 
in ways that go beyond traditional banking. We are 

succeeding with programs that take the concept of 

impacting lives to a whole new level. Our work with Stand

our Commercial verticals in healthcare, mid-corporate, 

and energy are ahead of the industry and allow us to serve 

clients at a higher level. In 2014, we added a retail-focused 

vertical as well. 
We are seeing greater utilization of the sophisticated 
payments, capital markets, and other non-credit products 

that we oer. Results showed our strong levels of treasury 

management sales, and we believe this business is growing 

at a rate more than double the industry. One of our treasury

in a Wall Street Journal
 article as a best practice in cash 
management. Ind led the largest rollout 
of smart safes in the United States, going out across 497 

locations, in 446 cities in 42 states.
Our prospects for success in treasury management 
are further enhanced through the realignment of our 

Payments and Commerce Solutions business. We created 

this new division to rethink those aspects of the customer 

experience, both for businesses and consumers, and to 

ys to turn our curiosity about new technology into 

greater value for customerrovides yet another 
example of how we are managing the Company to achieve

the resources of our existing businesses like treasury

through consolidated strategy, product development, 

and operational execution. We expect to leverage the 

Company’s scale and extensive payments infrastructure to 

provide solutions for complex, high-transaction industries 

and to capture new market development opportunities 

such as payment security, mobile payments, and cobranded 

cards and loyalty programs. 
Our commitment to improving the risk culture and 
achieving the right business mix atd extends 

to investments we are making in our infrastructure 

needed to support this enhancement. We are adding 

talented and experienced employees to our enterprise 

risk and compliance organizations and we will continue 

to invest in talent, training, and systems to maintain a 

strong and robust platform across our entire Company. 

We are working to make our strength in these areas a

our investments with disciplined expense management

those businesses, and we continue to identify areas where 
we could be moret.
Part of our approach as 
e curious bank 
is to ask questions 
and listen carefully. When we do that, we develop better 

solutions that represent greater value to customers – 

and we develop better solutions to the problems facing 

our communities. We’re putting people to work, we’re 

helping people buy thst home, we’re sending kids to 

college. We’re also expanding businesshting cancer, 

improving lives througncial empowerment, and so 

much more. We bring a spirit of teamwork, accountability, 

integrity, and respect to the way we work with customers. 

Delivering greater value to customers equals success 

in the marketplace, and helping solve problems in our 

communities means building a better environment for us 

and our customers.
I would personally like to thank William Isaac, Darryl 
Allen, and John Scr. who retired from thd 

Bancorp Board of Directors in Aprie leaders 

provnt guidance and contributions during 

one of the most challenging environments our industry has 

faced.llective experience proved invaluable and we 

are fortunate to have had the bet of their expertise. 
Our 2014 Employee Viewpoints Survey, administered 
by Gallup, showed that we continued to strengthen the 

Bank’s engaging and inclusive culture. We improved on 

every item, a clear sign that we are each committed to 

maintaining a great workplace, a place where employees 

can build their futures, win together, and impact lives. I 

thank all of our employees as well as my fellow directors 

for their commitment to our Company. Certainly, we are 

experiencing new challenges, but we are asking the right 

questions and pursuing promising strategies that are 

aligned with our risk appetite. 
With 2015 underway, our Vision remains our strongest 
aspiration: to become the one bank that people most value 

and trust. We have reframed our thinking to recognize the 

progress we have made so far and the work that remains at

Community Commitment 
d seeks to markedly improve the lives of our customers and communities. 
ur corporate social responsibility (CSR) and our Purpose. We consider 

carefully the needs of individuals, customers and communities, consistently working 

to achieve maximum impact. 
We do this by focusing on several key areas, those in which we 

have developed core competencies over the years, including 

reemployment anncial empowerment. We oer our 

signature programs at no cost to the communities we serve. 

y enable us to put oncial resources to the best use, 

and more important, to channel the generosity and passion 

of our employees into areas of great need and opportunity.  
Homeowner Reemployment is our innovative program 
with national reemployment solutions company NextJob, 

in which we help our unemployed mortgage customers 

land jobs. We do this by sponsoring them through 

NextJob’s comprehensive, three-part job training program, 
which includes personalized job coachinrogram, 
which hundreds of mortgage customers have now used 

and which boasts a success rate near 40 percent, earned 

d a Global Innovation Award in Societal and 

Community Impact from BAI-Finacle in 2014. We were 

the only U.S. bank to earn such honors. Since 2012, we 

have expanded access to the program, in whole and in 

part, tod customers year-round, and to non-

customers, including veterans, during special promotion 

periods. At the end of 2014, more than 7,200 individuals 

were using another tool—the free online training modules 

that comprise the Job Seeker’s Toolkit, also from NextJob—

through 
53.com
.  d’s suite of L.I.F.E. (Lives Improved through 
Financial Empowerment) programs further supports 

people, and at all ages and stages of life. We understand that 

knowledge and basic skills abouncial management 

can greatly aect one’s quality of life. Our L.I.F.E. programs 

include the Young Bankers Club foh-grade students; 

Dave Ramsey’s Foundations in Personal Finance course  

for high-school students; and Empowncial 
Randall Jackson was one of four original customers featured 
in a Fifth Third advertising and social media campaign 

designed to help job seekers reach prospective employers. He 

landed a job after being long-term unemployed and is among 

the near 40 percent of Bank NextJob participants to do so.

education classes for adults. We also oer SmallBizU 
online courses for entrepreneurs and small business 
ownerncial empowerment buses, or eBuses, 

takencial education directly into low- and moderate-

income communities we serve.
Additionally, our strategic alliances enable us to oer 
products that pair a qualitncial service with a 

community purpose. A prime example is thd 

Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C) credit and debit cards we have 

oered since 2013. Last year, we ran special promotions 

that enabled customers opening a new checking account 

to earn $150 for themselves and generate a $150 donation 

to SU2C, a charitable program dedicated to accelerating 

cancer research and saving lives. As a result of this and 

other campaigns betting SU2C, we have donated more 

than $4 million in recent years.
ank also continued oht against hunger. We use 
the calendar date of Mad Day—each year to 

support sustainable community gardens, raise money and 

volunteer toht hunger in our communities. In 2014, we 

provided 770,000 meals, representing an increase of more 

than 220,000 versus our 2013 total. 
Work in support of veterans is another important cause 
fod. In November, around the Veterans Day 
holiday, our employees volunteered for projects that 
commemorated, supported and raised funds for former 

and current U.S. military members and their families. In 

2014, we rehabbed veterans’ homes in 14 cities, conducted 

st-ever job fair for veterans and generated donations of 

nearly $300,000 for charities who serve veterans.
Our ongoing work with Project SEARCH, a school-
to-work transition program for high school students 

with developmental disabilities, bets individuals, 

communities, our employees, and our Bank. We were 

an original collaborator on Project SEARCH and today 

operate three Project SEARCH campuses. We’re proud 

that 25 Project SEARCH graduates are now valuh 

d team members. 
Atd, we all take our community responsibilities 
seriously. Our employees and Organization give time, 

talent and resources to improve the lives arou

commitment includes employee and corporate support of 

United Way, with more than $7 million donated in 2014, 

as well as ongoinorts that include volunteerism, non-

prot board leadership, community sponsorships and 

thought leadership. More information will be included in 

the 2014 CSR Report, available in April at

.Celebrating 10 years of service in 2014, Fifth Third’s Financial Empowerment Mobiles, or eBuses, have logged 202,000 miles sinc
e 2004. 
In 2014, Fifth Third Bank donated $190,000 to Rebuilding Together, 
an organization that rebuilds homes for low-income homeowners, 

to fund long-term home rebuilding projects for veterans. 

Tennessee-area employees volunteered for two of 14 rebuild 

projects across the Bank’s footprint during the month of November.

accounting or financial results of one or more acquired entities; (20) difficulties from Fifth Third™s investment in, relations
hip with, and nature of the operations of Vantiv, LLC; (21) loss of income from any sale or 
potential sale of businesses that could have an adverse effect
 on Fifth Third™s earnings and future growth; (22) ability to sec

MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  16  Fifth Third Bancorp 
OVERVIEW Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company 
headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At December 31, 2014, the 
Bancorp had $138.7 billion in assets, operated 15 affiliates with 
1,302 full-service Banking Centers, including 101 Bank Mart® 

locations open seven days a week inside select grocery stores, and 
2,638 ATMs in 12 states throughout the Midwestern and 
Southeastern regions of the U.S. The Bancorp reports on four 

business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, 

Consumer Lending and Investment Advisors. The Bancorp also has 

an approximate 23% interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC. The carrying 
value of the Bancorp™s investment in Vantiv Holding, LLC was $394 
million as of December 31, 2014. 
This overview of MD&A highlights selected information in the 
financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the 

information that is important to you. For a more complete 

understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, 

liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and 

estimates, you should carefully read this entire document. Each of 
these items could have an impact on the Bancorp™s financial 
condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, see the 

Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms in this report for a list of 

terms included as a tool for the reader of this annual report on 

Form 10-K. The abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are 

used throughout this MD&A, as well as the Consolidated Financial 

Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp believes that banking is first and foremost a 
relationship business where the strength of the competition and 
challenges for growth can vary in every market. The Bancorp 
believes its affiliate operating model provides a competitive 

advantage by emphasizing individual relationships. Through its 

affiliate operating model, individual managers at all levels within the 

affiliates are given the opportunity to tailor financial solutions for 

their customers. Net interest income, net interest margin and the efficiency ratio 
are presented in MD&A on a FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for 
the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities 

held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax 

purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the 

preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it 

provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable 
amounts.  The Bancorp™s revenues are dependent on both net interest 
income and noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 
2014, net interest income, on a FTE basis, and noninterest income 

provided 59% and 41% of total revenue, respectively. The Bancorp 

derives the majority of its revenues within the U.S. from customers 

domiciled in the United States. Revenue from foreign countries and 

external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to 
the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in 
interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets 
are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As 
discussed later in the Risk Management section, risk identification, 

measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to 

the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital 

strength of the Bancorp.  
Net interest income is the difference between interest income 
earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest 
expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by 
the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and 

long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the 

amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-

bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns 
on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of 
time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the 
Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to 
net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages 
this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of 

its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest 

rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes 

in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of 

business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as 

part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment 
risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of losses on its loan 
and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows 
caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and 

inadequate collateral due to a weakened economy within the 

Bancorp™s footprint. 
Noninterest income is derived from service charges on 
deposits, corporate banking revenue, investment advisory revenue, 

mortgage banking net revenue, card and processing revenue and 

other noninterest income. Noninterest expense is primarily driven 
by personnel costs, net occupancy expenses, technology and 
communication costs and other noninterest expense. 

 Vantiv, Inc. Share Sale  The Bancorp™s ownership position in Vantiv Holding, LLC was 

reduced in the second quarter of 2014 when the Bancorp sold an 

approximate three percent interest and recognized a $125 million 

gain. The Bancorp™s remaining approximate 23% ownership in 
Vantiv Holding, LLC was accounted for as an equity method 
investment in the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements and 

had a carrying value of $394 million as of December, 31, 2014. For 
more information, refer to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements.  

 
Accelerated Share Repurchase Transactions 

During 2013 and 2014, the Bancorp entered into a number of 
accelerated share repurchase transactions. As part of these 
transactions, the Bancorp entered into forward contracts in which 
the final number of shares to be delivered at settlement was or will 
be based generally on a discount to the average daily volume-

weighted average price of the Bancorp™s common stock during the 

term of the Repurchase Agreement. For more information on the 

accounting for these instruments, refer to Note 23 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements. For a summary of all accelerated 
share repurchase transactions entered into or settled during 2013 
and 2014 refer to Table 2. For further information on a subsequent 
event related to capital actions refer to Note 31 of the Notes to 

Consolidated Financial Statements.

Preferred Stock Offering 
On June 5, 2014, the Bancorp issued in a registered public offering 
300,000 depositary shares, representing 12,000 shares of 4.90% 

fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative Series J perpetual preferred 

stock, for net proceeds of $297 million. The Series J preferred 
shares are not convertible into Bancorp common shares or any 
other securities. For more information, refer to Note 23 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Senior Notes Offerings 
On February 28, 2014, the Bancorp issued and sold $500 million of 

2.30% unsecured senior fixed-rate notes, with a maturity of five 
years, due on March 1, 2019. These notes will be redeemable by the 
Bancorp, in whole or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days 

prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of 

the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but 

excluding the redemption date.  
On April 25, 2014, the Bank issued and sold $1.5 billion in 
aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior bank notes. The 

bank notes consisted of $850 million of 2.375% senior fixed-rate 
notes, with a maturity of five years, due on April 25, 2019; and $650 
million of 1.35% senior fixed-rate notes with a maturity of three 

years, due on June 1, 2017. These bank notes will be redeemable by 

the Bank, in whole or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days 

prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of 
the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but 
excluding, the redemption date.  
On September 5, 2014, the Bank issued and sold $850 million 
of 2.875% unsecured senior fixed-rate bank notes, with a maturity 

of seven years, due on October 1, 2021. These bank notes will be 

redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on or after the date 

that is 30 days prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal 

to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
up to, but excluding, the redemption date. For additional 
information on the senior notes offerings, refer to Note 16 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 
Automobile Loan Securitizations 

In securitization transactions that occurred in 2014, the Bancorp 

transferred an aggregate amount of approximately $3.8 billion in 

fixed-rate consumer automobile loans to bankruptcy remote trusts 
which were deemed to be VIEs. The Bancorp concluded that it is 
the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and, therefore, has 

consolidated these VIEs. For additional information on the 

automobile loan securitizations, refer to Notes 10 and 16 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 
 
 Legislative Developments 
On July 21, 2010, the DFA was signed into federal law. This act 
implements changes to the financial services industry and affects the 

lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of 

financial institutions and their holding companies. The legislation 

established the CFPB responsible for implementing and enforcing 
compliance with consumer financial laws, changes the methodology 
for determining deposit insurance assessments, gives the FRB the 

ability to regulate and limit interchange rates charged to merchants 
for the use of debit cards, enacts new limitations on proprietary 
trading, broadens the scope of derivative instruments subject to 

regulation, requires on-going stress tests and the submission of 

annual capital plans for certain organizations, requires changes to 

rules governing regulatory capital ratios and requires enhanced 
liquidity standards.  
The FRB launched the 2014 capital planning and stress testing 
program, CCAR, on November 1, 2013. The CCAR program 
requires BHCs with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets 
to submit annual capital plans to the FRB for review and to conduct 

stress tests under a number of economic scenarios. The capital plan 

and stress testing results were submitted by the Bancorp to the FRB 

on January 6, 2014. 
In March of 2014, the FRB disclosed its estimates of 
participating institutions results under the FRB supervisory stress 

scenario, including capital results, which assume all banks take 
certain consistently applied future capital actions. In addition, the 
FRB disclosed its estimates of participating institutions results under 

the FRB supervisory severe stress scenarios including capital results 
based on each company™s own base scenario capital actions. 
On March 26, 2014, the Bancorp announced the results of its 
capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of the 2014 CCAR. The 

FRB indicated to the Bancorp that it did not object to the following 

capital actions for the period beginning April 1, 2014 and ending 
March 31, 2015:  The potential increase in the quarterly common stock 
dividend to $0.13 per share; The potential repurchase of common shares in an 
amount up to $669 million; The additional ability to repurchase shares in the 
amount of any after-tax gains from the sale of Vantiv, 
Inc. common stock; and 
The issuance of an additional $300 million in 
preferred stock. 
 For more information on the 2014 CCAR results, refer to the 
Capital Management section of MD&A. 
  MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  18  Fifth Third Bancorp 
The BHCs that participated in the 2014 CCAR, including the 
Bancorp, were required to conduct mid-cycle company-run stress 

tests using data as of March 31, 2014. The stress tests must be based 

on three BHC defined economic scenarios Œ baseline, adverse and 
severely adverse. As required, the Bancorp reported the mid-cycle 
stress test results to the FRB on July 7, 2014. In addition, the 
Bancorp published a Form 8-K providing a summary of the results 

under the severely adverse scenario on September 18, 2014, which is 

available on Fifth Third™s website at https://www.53.com. These results represented estimates of the Bancorp™s results from the 

second quarter of 2014 through the second quarter of 2016 under 
the severely adverse scenario, which is considered highly unlikely to 
occur. Fifth Third offers qualified deposit customers a deposit 
advance product if they choose to avail themselves of this product 

to meet short-term, small-dollar financial needs. In April of 2013, 

the CFPB issued a ﬁWhite Paperﬂ which studied financial services 

industry offerings and customer use of deposit advance products as 

well as payday loans and is considering whether rules governing 
these products are warranted. At the same time, the OCC and FDIC 
each issued proposed supervisory guidance for public comment to 
institutions they supervise which supplements existing OCC and 
FDIC guidance, detailing the principles they expect financial 

institutions to follow in connection with deposit advance products 

and supervisory expectations for the use of deposit advance 

products. The Federal Reserve also issued a statement in April of 
2013 to state member banks like Fifth Third for whom the Federal 
Reserve is the primary regulator. This statement encouraged state 
member banks to respond to customers™ small-dollar credit needs in 
a responsible manner; emphasized that they should take into 

consideration the risks associated with deposit advance products, 

including potential consumer harm and potential elevated 

compliance risk; and reminded them that these product offerings 

must comply with applicable laws and regulations.  
Fifth Third™s deposit advance product is designed to fully 
comply with the applicable federal and state laws and use of this 
product is subject to strict eligibility requirements and advance 
restriction guidelines to limit dependency on this product as a 

borrowing source. The Bancorp™s deposit advance balances are 

included in other consumer loans and leases in the Bancorp™s 

Consolidated Balance Sheets and represent substantially all of the 
revenue reported in interest and fees on other consumer loans and 
leases in the Bancorp™s Consolidated Statements of Income and in 

Table 8 in the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A. 
On January 17, 2014, given developments in industry practice, Fifth 
Third announced that it would no longer enroll new customers in its 

deposit advance product and expected to phase out the service to 

existing customers by the end of 2014. To avoid a disruption to its 

existing customers during the extension period while the banking 
industry awaits further regulatory guidance on the deposit advance 
product, on November 3, 2014, Fifth Third announced changes to 

its current deposit advance product for existing customers 
beginning January 1, 2015, including a lower transaction fee, an 
extended repayment period and a reduced maximum advance 

period. The Bancorp currently expects to continue to offer the 

service to existing deposit advance customers until further 
regulatory guidance is provided. The Bancorp currently expects 
these changes to the deposit advance product to negatively impact 

net interest income by approximately $100 million in 2015. 
In December of 2010 and revised in June of 2011, the BCBS 
issued Basel III, a global regulatory framework, to enhance 
international capital standards. In June of 2012, U.S. banking 

regulators proposed enhancements to the regulatory capital 

requirements for U.S. banks, which implement aspects of Basel III, 
such as re-defining the regulatory capital elements and minimum 
capital ratios, introducing regulatory capital buffers above those 
minimums, revising the agencies™ rules for calculating risk-weighted 

assets and introducing a new Tier I common equity ratio. In July of 

2013, U.S. banking regulators approved the final enhanced 
regulatory capital rules (Basel III Final Rule), which included 
modifications to the proposed rules. The Bancorp continues to 

evaluate the Basel III Final Rule and its potential impact. For more 

information on the impact of the regulatory capital enhancements, 

refer to the Capital Management section of MD&A. Refer to the 

Non-GAAP section of MD&A for an estimate of the Basel III Tier 

I common equity ratio. On December 10, 2013, the banking agencies finalized section 
619 of the DFA, known as the Volcker Rule, which became 
effective April 1, 2014. Though the final rule was effective April 1, 

2014, the FRB granted the industry an extension of time until July 
21, 2015 to conform certain of its activities related to proprietary 
trading to comply with the Volcker Rule. In addition, the FRB has 

granted the industry an extension of time until July 21, 2016, and 

announced its intention to grant a one year extension of the 

conformance period until July 21, 2017, to conform certain 
ownership interests in, sponsorship activities of and relationships 
with private equity or hedge funds as well as holding certain 
collateralized loan obligations that were in place as of December 31, 
2013. It is possible that additional conformance period extensions 

could be granted either to the entire industry, or, upon request, to 

requesting banking organizations on a case-by-case basis. The final 

rule prohibits banks and bank holding companies from engaging in 

short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, 
commodity futures and options on these instruments for their own 
account. The Volcker Rule also restricts banks and their affiliated 

entities from owning, sponsoring or having certain relationships 
with private equity and hedge funds, as well as holding certain 

collateralized loan obligations that are deemed to contain ownership 

interests. Exemptions are provided for certain activities such as 

underwriting, market making, hedging, trading in certain 
government obligations and organizing and offering a hedge fund or 
private equity fund. Fifth Third does not sponsor any private equity 
or hedge funds that, under the final rule, it is prohibited from 

sponsoring. As of December 31, 2014, the Bancorp held no 
collateralized loan obligations. As of December 31, 2014, the 

Bancorp had approximately $165 million in interests and 

approximately $60 million in binding commitments to invest in 
private equity funds that are affected by the Volcker Rule. It is 
expected that over time the Bancorp may need to sell or redeem 
these investments, however no formal plan to sell has been 
approved as of December 31, 2014. As a result of the announced 

conformance period extension, the Bancorp believes it is likely that 

these investments will be reduced over time in the ordinary course 

of events before compliance is required. 
On October 10, 2014, the U.S. Banking Agencies published 
final rules implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement 

consistent with the LCR standard established by the BCBS for large 
internationally active banking organizations, generally those with 
$250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or 

more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure.  In addition, a modified 

LCR requirement was implemented for BHCs with $50 billion or 

more in total consolidated assets but that are not internationally 

active, such as Fifth Third. The modified LCR is effective January 1, 

2016 and requires BHCs to calculate its LCR on a monthly basis. 

Refer to the Liquidity Risk Management section of MD&A for 
further discussion on these ratios.  
On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of 
Columbia issued an order granting summary judgment to the 

plaintiffs in a case challenging certain provisions of the FRB™s rule 

concerning electronic debit card transaction fees and network 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 19  Fifth Third Bancorp 
exclusivity arrangements (the ﬁCurrent Ruleﬂ) that were adopted to 
implement Section 1075 of the DFA, known as the Durbin 

Amendment. The Court held that, in adopting the Current Rule, the 

FRB violated the Durbin Amendment™s provisions concerning 

which costs are allowed to be taken into account for purposes of 

setting fees that are reasonable and proportional to the costs 
incurred by the issuer and therefore the Current Rule™s maximum 
permissible fees were too high. In addition, the Court held that the 

Current Rule™s network non-exclusivity provisions concerning 

unaffiliated payment networks for debit cards also violated the 

Durbin Amendment. The Court vacated the Current Rule, but 

stayed its ruling to provide the FRB an opportunity to replace the 
invalidated portions. The FRB appealed this decision and on March 
21, 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District 

Court™s grant of summary judgment and remanded the case for 

further proceedings in accordance with its opinion. The merchants 

have filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. 

However, on January 20, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to 
hear an appeal of the Circuit Court reversal, thereby largely 
upholding the Current Rule and substantially reducing uncertainty 

surrounding debit card interchange fees the Bancorp is permitted to 

charge. Refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the 

Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A for further 

information regarding the Bancorp™s debit card interchange revenue.

 Earnings Summary 
The Bancorp™s net income available to common shareholders for 

the year ended December 31, 2014 was$1.4 billion, or $1.66 per 

diluted share, which was net of $67 million in preferred stock 
dividends. The Bancorp™s net income available to common 
shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1.8 billion, 

or $2.02 per diluted share, which was net of $37 million in preferred 
stock dividends. Pre-provision net revenue was $2.3 billion and $2.8 
billion for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, 

respectively. Pre-provision net revenue is a non-GAAP measure. 

For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial 

Measures section in the MD&A. Net interest income was $3.6 billion for both the years ended 
December 31, 2014 and 2013. Net interest income was positively 
impacted by an increase in average taxable securities of $5.4 billion 
for the year ended December 31, 2014 coupled with an increase in 

yields on these securities of 16 bps compared to the prior year. In 

addition, net interest income also included the benefit of an increase 

in average loans and leases and a decrease in the rates paid on long-

term debt compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower yields 
on loans and leases and an increase in average long-term debt. The 
net interest rate spread decreased to 2.94% in 2014 from 3.15% in 
2013 primarily due to a 21 bps decrease in yields on average interest-
earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net interest 

margin was 3.10% and 3.32% for the years ended December 31, 

2014 and 2013, respectively. Noninterest income decreased $754 million, or 23%, in 2014 
compared to 2013. The decrease from the prior year was primarily 
due to decreases in mortgage banking net revenue and other 
noninterest income. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $390 
million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the 

prior year primarily due to decreases in origination fees and gains on 

loan sales and net mortgage servicing revenue. Other noninterest 

income decreased $429 million compared to the prior year. The 

decrease included the impact of a gain of $125 million on the sale of 

Vantiv, Inc. shares in the second quarter of 2014, compared to gains 
totaling $327 million during the second and third quarters of 2013. 
The Bancorp recognized gains of $23 million and $9 million 
associated with a tax receivable agreement with Vantiv, Inc. in the 

fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively. Additionally, other 

noninterest income decreased for the year ended December 31, 

2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to decreases in the positive 

valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv 
Holding, LLC and a decrease in equity method earnings from 
Vantiv Holding, LLC.  
Noninterest expense decreased $252 million, or six percent, in 
2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to decreases in total personnel 
costs and other noninterest expense. Total personnel costs 
decreased $155 million in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by a 

decrease in incentive compensation primarily in the mortgage 

business due to lower production levels and a decrease in base 
compensation and employee benefits as a result of a decline in the 
number of full-time equivalent employees. Other noninterest 

expense decreased $125 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily 

due to decreases in loan and lease expense, FDIC insurance and 
other taxes, losses and adjustments, marketing expense, debt 
extinguishment costs and an increase in the benefit from the reserve 

for unfunded commitments, partially offset by an increase in 

impairment on affordable housing investments.  
 Credit Summary 

The provision for loan and lease losses was $315 million and $229 

million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, 
respectively. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans 
and leases increased to 0.64% during 2014 compared to 0.58% 

during 2013. At December 31, 2014, nonperforming assets as a 
percent of loans, leases and other assets, including OREO 

(excluding nonaccrual loans held for sale) decreased to 0.82%, 
compared to 1.10% at December 31, 2013. For further discussion 

on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management section in 

MD&A.  Capital Summary 

The Bancorp™s capital ratios exceed the ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ guidelines 

as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 

System. As of December 31, 2014, the Tier I risk-based capital ratio 

was 10.83%, the Tier I leverage ratio was 9.66% and the Total risk-

based capital ratio was 14.33%.  MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 21  Fifth Third Bancorp 
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
The following are Non-GAAP measures which are important to the 
reader of the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements but 

should be supplemental to primary GAAP measures. The Bancorp 

considers many factors when determining the adequacy of its 
liquidity profile, including its LCR as defined by the U.S. Banking 
Agencies Basel III LCR final rule. Generally, the LCR is designed to 
ensure banks maintain an adequate level of unencumbered HQLA 

to satisfy the estimated net cash outflows under a 30-day stress 

scenario. The Bancorp will be subject to the Modified LCR whereby 
the net cash outflow under the 30-day stress scenario is multiplied 
by a factor of 0.7. The final rule is not effective for the Bancorp 

until January 1, 2016. The Bancorp believes there is no comparable 

U.S. GAAP financial measure to LCR. The Bancorp believes 
providing an estimated LCR is important for comparability to other 
financial institutions. For a further discussion on liquidity 

management and the LCR, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management 

section of MD&A.

institutions, but is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is 
considered a non-GAAP financial measure.The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP for the

               The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital 
utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio, tangible 

common equity ratio and Tier I common equity ratio, in addition to 

capital ratios defined by banking regulators. These calculations are 

intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking 

regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because 
U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp 
believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to 

these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or 

codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are 

considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Since analysts and 

banking regulators may assess the Bancorp™s capital adequacy using 
these ratios, the Bancorp believes they are useful to provide 
investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis. 
The Bancorp believes these non-GAAP measures are 
important because they reflect the level of capital available to 

withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation 

of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of the 
Bancorp™s capitalization to other organizations. However, because 
there are no standardized definitions for these ratios, the Bancorp™s 
calculations may not be comparable with other organizations, and 

the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited. As a 

result, the Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Consolidated 

Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single 

financial measure.

  22  Fifth Third Bancorp 
U.S. banking regulators approved
 final capital rules (Basel III 
Final Rule) in July of 2013 that substantially amend the existing risk-

based capital rules (Basel I) for banks. The Bancorp believes 

providing an estimate of its capital position based upon the final 
rules is important to complement the existing capital ratios and for 
comparability to other financial institutions. Since these rules are not 
effective for the Bancorp until January 1, 2015, they are considered 

non-GAAP measures and therefore are included in the following 

non-GAAP financial measures table.  The following table reconciles non-GAAP capital ratios to U.S. GAAP as of December 31:

MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 23  Fifth Third Bancorp 
RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides 
a discussion of the significant new accounting standards adopted by 
the Bancorp during 2014 and the expected impact of significant 
accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted.  
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in 

accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require 

management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, 

economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the 

Bancorp™s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Bancorp™s critical accounting policies include the accounting for 
the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, income taxes, 

valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and 

legal contingencies. No material changes were made to the valuation 

techniques or models described below during the year ended 

December 31, 2014. 
ALLL 
The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into 

portfolio segments for purposes
 of determining the ALLL. The 
Bancorp™s portfolio segments include commercial, residential 

mortgage, and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its 
portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and 
assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. Classes 

within the commercial portfolio segment include commercial and 
industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial 
mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction, and 

commercial leasing. The residential mortgage portfolio segment is 

also considered a class. Classes within the consumer portfolio 
segment include home equity, automobile, credit card, and other 
consumer loans and leases. For an analysis of the Bancorp™s ALLL 

by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to 

Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb probable loan 
and lease losses inherent in its 
portfolio segments. The ALLL is 
maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is 

based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the 
collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. 

Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. 
Provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the Bancorp™s 

review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, 
in management™s judgment, deserve consideration under existing 
economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. The 

Bancorp™s strategy for credit risk management includes a 
combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below 
legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation 

and collections standards. The strategy also emphasizes 

diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular 

credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large 
credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit 
quality. 
The Bancorp™s methodology for determining the ALLL is 
based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific 
allocation on loans modified in a TDR and impaired commercial 

credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. 

Allowances on individual commercial loans, TDRs and historical 

loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on 
changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual 
collection and charge-off experience. An unallocated allowance is 

maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and 
measuring losses when evaluating allowances for individual loans or 
pools of loans. 
Larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower 
relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or 
observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been 
modified in a TDR, are subject to individual review for impairment. 

The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality 
of any guarantees, the guarantor™s liquidity and willingness to 

cooperate, the loan structure, and other factors when evaluating 
whether an individual loan is impaired. Other factors may include 
the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and 

financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the 

borrower, and the Bancorp™s evaluation of the borrower™s 
management. When individual loans are impaired, allowances are 
determined based on management™s estimate of the borrower™s 

ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other 

sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options 
available to the Bancorp. Allowances for impaired loans are 
measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows 

discounted at the loan™s effective interest rate, fair value of the 
underlying collateral or readily observable secondary market values. 
The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and 

interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. 
Historical credit loss rates are applied to commercial loans that 
are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established 
threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance 
allocations. The loss rates are derived from a migration analysis, 
which tracks the historical net charge-off experience sustained on 
loans according to their internal risk grade. The risk grading system 

utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten categories. 
Homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and 
consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded. 

Rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring 
are used to assess credit risks, and allowances are established based 
on the expected net charge-offs. Loss rates are based on the trailing 

twelve month net charge-off history by loan category. Historical loss 
rates may be adjusted for certain prescriptive and qualitative factors 

that, in management™s judgment, are necessary to reflect losses 

inherent in the portfolio. Factors that management considers in the 

analysis include the effects of the national and local economies; 
trends in the nature and volume of delinquencies, charge-offs and 
nonaccrual loans; changes in loan mix; credit score migration 
comparisons; asset quality trends; risk management and loan 
administration; changes in the internal lending policies and credit 

standards; collection practices; and examination results from bank 

regulatory agencies and the Bancorp™s internal credit reviewers. 
The Bancorp™s primary market areas for lending are the 
Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States. When 
evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to 
these regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated 
effect changing economic conditions have on the Bancorp™s 
customers. Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 
The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level 

believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated 
probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included 
in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 

determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an 
evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment 
of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading 

and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. This 

process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  24  Fifth Third Bancorp 
analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorp™s 
ALLL, as discussed above. Net adjustments to the reserve for 

unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense 

in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Income Taxes The Bancorp estimates income tax expense based on amounts 

expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which the 
Bancorp conducts business. On a quarterly basis, management 
assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its 

current estimate of the amount and components of net income, tax 

credits and the applicable statutory tax rates expected for the full 
year. The estimated income tax expense is recorded in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using 
the balance sheet method and the net deferred tax asset or liability is 
reported in other assets or accrued taxes, interest and expenses, 
respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under this 

method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax 

effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets 
and liabilities, and reflects enacted changes in tax rates and laws. 
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent they exist and are 

subject to a valuation allowance based on management™s judgment 

that realization is more likely than not. This analysis is performed on 

a quarterly basis and includes an evaluation of all positive and 

negative evidence, such as the limitation on the use of any net 

operating losses, to determine whether realization is more likely 

than not. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to 
taxing jurisdictions and are reported in accrued taxes, interest and 

expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp 
evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax 
treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering 

statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information and 

maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these relative 

risks and merits. Changes to the estimate of accrued taxes occur 
periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, 
the status of examinations being conducted by taxing authorities 
and changes to statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that 
impact the relative risks of tax positions. These changes, when they 

occur, can affect deferred taxes and accrued taxes as well as the 

current period™s income tax expense and can be significant to the 

operating results of the Bancorp. For additional information on 
income taxes, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
Valuation of Servicing Rights 
When the Bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or 
individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies, it 

often obtains servicing rights. Servicing rights resulting from loan 

sales are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized 
in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing 
revenue. Servicing rights are assessed for impairment monthly, 
based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through 

a valuation allowance and permanent impairment recognized 

through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation 

allowance. Key economic assumptions used in measuring any 

potential impairment of the servicing rights include the prepayment 

speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the 
discount rate and the weighted-average coupon rate, as applicable. 
The primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing 
rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions 

used, particularly the prepayment speeds. The Bancorp monitors 

risk and adjusts its valuation allowance as necessary to adequately 

reserve for impairment in the servicing portfolio. For purposes of 
measuring impairment, the mortgage servicing rights are stratified 
into classes based on the financial asset type (fixed-rate vs. 

adjustable rate) and interest rates. For additional information on 

servicing rights, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
Fair Value Measurements 
The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair 
value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the 

price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 

liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. Valuation techniques the Bancorp uses to 
measure fair value include the market approach, income approach 
and cost approach. The market approach uses prices or relevant 

information generated by market transactions involving identical or 

comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves 

discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based 

on current market expectations about those future amounts. The 

cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be 
required to replace the service capacity of the asset. 
U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes 
the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into 

three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority 

to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

(Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A 
financial instrument™s categorization within the fair value hierarchy 
is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the 
instrument™s fair value measurement. The three levels within the fair 
value hierarchy are described as follows: 
Level 1 Œ Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities that the Bancorp has the 

ability to access at the measurement date. 
Level 2 Œ Inputs other than quoted prices included within 
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 

either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: 

quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active 
markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or 
liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than 

quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; 

and inputs that are derived principally from or 
corroborated by observable market data by correlation 
or other means. 
Level 3 Œ Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for 
which there is little, if any, market activity at the 
measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect the 

Bancorp™s own assumptions about what market 

participants would use to price the asset or liability. The 

inputs are developed based on the best information 
available in the circumstances, which might include the 
Bancorp™s own financial data such as internally 

developed pricing models and DCF methodologies, as 
well as instruments for which the fair value 

determination requires significant management judgment. The Bancorp™s fair value measurements involve various 
valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are 
observable, when available. Valuation techniques and parameters 

used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated 

by the Bancorp on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Bancorp 

monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a 

variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 25  Fifth Third Bancorp 
exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to 
previous trades and overall review and assessments for 

reasonableness. The following is a summary of valuation techniques 

utilized by the Bancorp for its significant assets and liabilities 

measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
  Available-for-sale and trading securities 
Where quoted prices are available in an active market, 

securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation 

hierarchy. Level 1 securities include government bonds 

and exchange traded equities. If quoted market prices are 

not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing 

models, quoted prices of securities with similar 

characteristics, or DCFs. Examples of such instruments, 

which are classified within Level 2 of the valuation 
hierarchy, include federal agencies, obligations of states 
and political subdivisions, agency residential mortgage-

backed securities, agency and non-agency commercial 
mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities 
and other debt securities. Corporate bonds are included 

in asset-backed securities and other debt securities. 

Federal agencies, obligations of states and political 

subdivisions, agency residential mortgage-backed 
securities, agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and other 
debt securities are generally valued using a market 
approach based on observable prices of securities with 

similar characteristics. Residential mortgage loans held for sale and held 
for investment 
For residential mortgage loans held for sale for which 
the fair value election has been made, fair value is 

estimated based upon mortgage-backed securities prices 
and spreads to those prices or, for certain ARM loans, 
DCF models that may incorporate the anticipated 

portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-backed 
securities with similar collateral, and market conditions. 
The anticipated portfolio composition includes the effect 

of interest rate spreads and discount rates due to loan 

characteristics such as the state in which the loan was 

originated, the loan amount and the ARM margin. 

Residential mortgage loans held for sale that are valued 

based on mortgage-backed securities prices are classified 

within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as the valuation 
is based on external pricing for similar instruments. 
ARM loans classified as held for sale are also classified 

within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy due to the use 

of observable inputs in the DCF model. These 

observable inputs include interest rate spreads from 
agency mortgage-backed securities market rates and 

observable discount rates. For residential mortgage loans 

in which the fair value election has been made that are 
subsequently reclassified from held for sale to held for 
investment, the fair value estimation is based on 

mortgage-backed securities prices, interest rate risk and 

an internally developed credit component. Therefore, 
these loans are classified within Level 3 of the valuation 
hierarchy. Derivatives 
Exchange-traded derivatives valued using quoted prices 

and certain over-the-counter derivatives valued using 

active bids are classified within Level 1 of the valuation 
hierarchy. Most of the Bancorp™s derivative contracts are 
valued using DCF or other models that incorporate 

current market interest rates, credit spreads assigned to 

the derivative counterparties, and other market 

parameters and, therefore, are classified within Level 2 

of the valuation hierarchy. Such derivatives include basic 
and structured interest rate swaps and options. 
Derivatives that are valued based upon models with 

significant unobservable market parameters are classified 

within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. At 

December 31, 2014, derivatives classified as Level 3, 

which are valued using an option-pricing model 

containing unobservable inputs, consisted primarily of 

the warrant associated with the initial sale of the 
Bancorp™s 51% interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC to 
Advent International and a total return swap associated 

with the Bancorp™s sale of its Visa, Inc. Class B shares. 

Level 3 derivatives also include IRLCs, which utilize 

internally generated loan closing rate assumptions as a 

significant unobservable input in the valuation process. In addition to the assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
on a recurring basis, the Bancorp measures servicing rights, certain 
loans and long-lived assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 

Refer to Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

for further information on fair value measurements. 
Goodwill
 Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include 
the acquisition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be 

tested for impairment at the Bancorp™s reporting unit level on an 

annual basis, which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more 
frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be 

impairment. The Bancorp has determined that its segments qualify 
as reporting units under U.S. GAAP. 
Impairment exists when a reporting unit™s carrying amount of 
goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for 

impairment, U.S. GAAP permits the Bancorp to first assess 

qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not 
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. 
In this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluates events and 

circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general 

economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, 
the overall financial performance of the Bancorp, the performance 
of the Bancorp™s stock, the key financial performance metrics of the 

reporting units, and events affecting the reporting units. If, after 

assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Bancorp 
determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a 
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the 

two-step impairment test would be unnecessary. However, if the 

Bancorp concludes otherwise, it would then be required to perform 
the first step (Step 1) of the goodwill impairment test, and continue 
to the second step (Step 2), if necessary. Step 1 compares the fair 

value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including 

goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its 
fair value, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is performed to 
measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be 
received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. Since none of the 
Bancorp™s reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting 

unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the 
Bancorp™s stock price. To determine the fair value of a reporting 
unit, the Bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  26  Fifth Third Bancorp 
reporting unit™s forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value 
approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the 

forecast) and the reporting unit™s estimated cost of equity as the 

discount rate. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market 
capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the 
Bancorp™s stock during the month including the measurement date, 
incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this 

market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of 

the Bancorp™s reporting units in order to corroborate the results of 

the income approach. 
When required to perform Step 2, the Bancorp compares the 
implied fair value of a reporting unit™s goodwill with the carrying 
amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied 
fair value, an impairment loss equal to that excess amount is 
recognized. A recognized impairment loss cannot exceed the 

carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed in future 

periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers. 
During Step 2, the Bancorp determines the implied fair value 
of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the 
reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including 
any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been 
acquired in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of 

the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and 

liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This assignment 

process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for 

impairment. The Bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of 
recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if appropriate), 
nor recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of this assignment 
process. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 

Statements for further information regarding the Bancorp™s 

goodwill. 
  Legal Contingencies The Bancorp is party to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as 

threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising 

from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims 
or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently 
difficult to predict, and significant judgment may be required in the 
determination of both the probability of loss and whether the 
amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Bancorp™s estimates 

are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory 

proceedings, the merit of the Bancorp™s defenses and consultation 

with internal and external legal counsel. A reserve for a potential 

litigation loss is established when information related to the loss 
contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the 
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. This reserve is included 
in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is 

adjusted from time to time as appropriate to reflect changes in 

circumstances. Legal expenses are recorded in other noninterest 

expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 27  Fifth Third Bancorp 
RISK FACTORS 
The risks listed below present risks that could have a material 
impact on the Bancorp™s financial condition, the results of its 

operations, or its business.  
 RISKS RELATING TO ECONOMIC AND MARKET 

CONDITIONS 

 Weakness in the U.S. economy, including within Fifth Third™s 
geographic footprint, has adversely affected Fifth Third in the 
past and may adversely affect Fifth Third in the future. 
If the strength of the U.S. economy in general or the strength of the 

local economies in which Fifth Third conducts operations declines 
this could result in, among other things, a deterioration in credit 
quality or a reduced demand for credit, including a resultant effect 

on Fifth Third™s loan portfolio and ALLL and in the receipt of 
lower proceeds from the sale of loans and foreclosed properties. 
These factors could result in higher delinquencies, greater charge-

offs and increased losses in future periods, which could materially 

adversely affect Fifth Third™s financial condition and results of 

operations.  The global financial markets continue to be strained as a 
result of economic slowdowns and concerns, especially about 
the creditworthiness of the European Union member states 
and financial institutions in the European Union.  These 
factors could have international implications, which could 
hinder the U.S. economic recovery and affect the stability of 
global financial markets.
 Certain European Union member states have fiscal obligations 
greater than their fiscal revenue, which has caused investor concern 

over such countries™ ability to continue to service their debt and 

foster economic growth in their economies. The European debt 
crisis and measures adopted to address it have significantly 
weakened European economies. A weaker European economy may 

cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of 

European financial institutions and the stability of European 
member economies. A failure to adequately address sovereign debt 
concerns in Europe could hamper economic recovery or contribute 

to recessionary economic conditions and severe stress in the 
financial markets, including in the United States. Should the U.S. 
economic recovery be adversely impacted by these factors, the 

likelihood for loan and asset growth at U.S. financial institutions, 

like Fifth Third, may deteriorate.  
 Changes in interest rates could affect Fifth Third™s income and 
cash flows. Fifth Third™s income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the 

difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning 

assets such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates 

paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. 
These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond 
Fifth Third™s control, including general economic conditions and the 
policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies (in 
particular, the FRB). Changes in monetary policy, including changes 

in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the 

prepayment speed of loans, the purchase of investments, the 

generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and 

investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of 
funding. The impact of these changes may be magnified if Fifth 
Third does not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of its assets 
and liabilities to changes in market interest rates. Fluctuations in 
these areas may adversely affect Fifth Third and its shareholders. 
Changes and trends in the capital markets may affect Fifth 
Third™s income and cash flows. Fifth Third enters into and maintains trading and investment 

positions in the capital markets on its own behalf and manages 
investment positions on behalf of its customers. These investment 
positions include derivative financial instruments. The revenues and 
profits Fifth Third derives from managing proprietary and customer 

trading and investment positions are dependent on market prices. 
Market changes and trends may result in a decline in investment 

advisory revenue or investment or trading losses that may impact 

Fifth Third. Losses on behalf of its customers could expose Fifth 

Third to litigation, credit risks or loss of revenue from those 
customers. Additionally, losses in Fifth Third™s trading and 
investment positions could lead to a loss with respect to those 
investments and may adversely affect cash flows and funding costs. 
 Problems encountered by financial institutions larger than or 
similar to Fifth Third could adversely affect financial markets 
generally and have indirect adverse effects on Fifth Third.  
 The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be 
closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other 
relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, 

or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to 
significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or 
defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as 

ﬁsystemic riskﬂ and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, 

such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms 

and exchanges, with which the Bancorp interacts on a daily basis, 
and therefore could adversely affect Fifth Third. 
 Fifth Third™s stock price is volatile. 
Fifth Third™s stock price has been volatile in the past and several 

factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. 

These factors include: 
Actual or anticipated variations in earnings; 
Changes in analysts™ recommendations or projections; 
Fifth Third™s announcements of developments related to 
its businesses; Operating and stock performance of other companies 
deemed to be peers;  
Actions by government regulators; 
New technology used or services offered by traditional 
and non-traditional competitors; 
News reports of trends, concerns and other issues related 
to the financial services industry; Natural disasters; 
Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism 
or military conflicts.  
The price for shares of Fifth Third™s common stock may fluctuate 

significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to 

Fifth Third™s performance. General market price declines or market 

volatility in the future could adversely affect the price for shares of 
Fifth Third™s common stock, and the current market price of such 
shares may not be indicative of future market prices. 
   MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  28  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer 
behavior may adversely impact Fifth Third™s investments in its 
bank premises and equipment and other assets and may lead 
to increased expenditures to ch
ange its retail
 distribution 
channel Fifth Third has significant investments in bank premises and 

equipment for its branch network including its 1,302 full service 

banking centers, 93 parcels of land held for the development of 

future banking centers, as well as its retail work force and other 

branch banking assets. Advances in technology such as e-commerce, 

telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service 

technologies including automatic teller machines and other 
equipment, as well as changing customer preferences for these other 
methods of accessing Fifth Third™s products and services, could 

decrease the value of Fifth Third™s branch network or other retail 

distribution assets and may cause it to change its retail distribution 

strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held 

for development and restructure or reduce its remaining branches 

and work force. These actions could lead to losses on these assets or 

could adversely impact the carrying value of other long-lived assets 
and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate and reconfigure 
remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution 
channel.  
RISKS RELATING TO FIFTH THIRD™S GENERAL 

BUSINESS 
 Deteriorating credit quality, particularly in real estate loans, 
has adversely impacted Fifth Third in the past and may 
adversely impact Fifth Third in the future. 
When Fifth Third lends money or commits to lend money the 

Bancorp incurs credit risk or the risk of loss if borrowers do not 

repay their loans. The credit performance of the loan portfolios 
significantly affects the Bancorp™s financial results and condition. If 
the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more 

customers may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other 
obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and 
reserves for credit losses. Fifth Third reserves for credit losses by 

establishing reserves through a charge to earnings. The amount of 

these reserves is based on Fifth Third™s assessment of credit losses 

inherent in the loan portfolio (including unfunded credit 
commitments). The process for determining the amount of the 
ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments is critical to Fifth 

Third™s financial results and condition. It requires difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about the environment, including 
analysis of economic or market conditions that might impair the 

ability of borrowers to repay their loans. 
Fifth Third might underestimate the credit losses inherent in its 
loan portfolio and have credit losses in excess of the amount 
reserved. Fifth Third might increase the reserve because of changing 

economic conditions, including falling home prices or higher 

unemployment, or other factors such as changes in borrower™s 
behavior. As an example, borrowers may "strategically default," or 
discontinue making payments on their real estate-secured loans if 

the value of the real estate is less than what they owe, even if they 

are still financially able to make the payments.  
Fifth Third believes that both the ALLL and the reserve for 
unfunded commitments are adequate to cover inherent losses at 

December 31, 2014; however, there is no assurance that they will be 

sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if housing and 
employment conditions worsen. In the event of significant 
deterioration in economic conditions, Fifth Third may be required 

to increase reserves in future periods, which would reduce earnings. 
For more information, refer to the "Risk Management - Credit 
Risk Management," "Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for 
Loan and Leases,ﬂ and ﬁReserve for Unfunded Commitmentsﬂ 
sections of MD&A.  
 Fifth Third must maintain adequate sources of funding and 
liquidity. 
Fifth Third must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal 
course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding 

liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations.  Fifth Third 
primarily relies on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source 
of funding for the loans Fifth Third makes and the operations of 

Fifth Third™s business. Core customer deposits, which include 

transaction deposits and other time deposits, have historically 
provided Fifth Third with a sizeable source of relatively stable and 
low-cost funds (average core deposits funded 71% of average total 

assets at December 31, 2014). In addition to customer deposits, 

sources of liquidity include investments in the securities portfolio, 
Fifth Third™s sale or securitization of loans in secondary markets 
and the pledging of loans and investment securities to access 

secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and the FRB, and 

Fifth Third™s ability to raise funds in domestic and international 
money and capital markets. 
Fifth Third™s liquidity and ability to fund and run the business 
could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and 
factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and 
volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial 

markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial 

crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of customer 

deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access 
capital markets on favorable terms.  
Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely 
affect Fifth Third™s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or 

customer confidence in Fifth Third or negative news about Fifth 

Third or the financial services industry generally which also may 

result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to 

access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to 

alternative investments;  inability to sell or securitize loans or other 
assets, increased regulatory requirements, and reductions in one or 
more of Fifth Third™s credit ratings. A reduced credit rating could 
adversely affect Fifth Third™s ability to borrow funds and raise the 
cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and 

business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other 

actions that could adversely affect Fifth Third™s ability to raise 

capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by 
events over which Fifth Third has little or no control such as what 
occurred during the financial crisis. While market conditions have 
stabilized and, in many cases, improved, there can be no assurance 
that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will 

not occur in the future. 
Recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk 
management may also negatively impact Fifth Third™s results of 

operations and competitive position.  Various regulations recently 

adopted or proposed, and additional regulations under 
consideration, impose or could impose more stringent liquidity 
requirements for large financial institutions, including Fifth Third.  
These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress 

testing, minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on short-

term debt issued by top-tier holding companies. Given the overlap 

and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory 

changes, including the resolution and recovery framework 
applicable to Fifth Third, the full impact of the adopted and 
proposed regulations will remain uncertain until their full 
implementation.  If Fifth Third is unable to continue to fund assets through 
customer bank deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms 

or if Fifth Third suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 29  Fifth Third Bancorp 
fails to manage liquidity effectively; liquidity, operating margins, 
financial results and condition may be materially adversely affected. 

As Fifth Third did during the financial crisis, it may also need to 

raise additional capital through the issuance of stock, which could 

dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or even 

eliminate common stock dividends to preserve capital. 
 Fifth Third may have 
more credit risk and higher credit losses 
to the extent loans are concentrated by location or industry of 
the borrowers or collateral. 
Fifth Third™s credit risk and credit losses can increase if its loans are 
concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities 

or to borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or 
disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. 
Deterioration in economic conditions, housing conditions and real 
estate values in these states and generally across the country could 
result in materially higher credit losses.
   Fifth Third may be required to repurchase residential 
mortgage loans or reimburse inve
stors and others as a result of 
breaches in contractual representations and warranties. 
Fifth Third sells residential mortgage loans to various parties, 
including GSEs and other financial institutions that purchase 
residential mortgage loans for investment or private label 

securitization. Fifth Third may be required to repurchase residential 

mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or 
insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for 
credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach of 

contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within 

a period (usually 60 days or less) after Fifth Third receives notice of 
the breach. Contracts for residential mortgage loan sales to the 
GSEs include various types of specific remedies and penalties that 

could be applied to inadequate responses to repurchase requests. If 
economic conditions and the housing market deteriorate or future 
investor repurchase demand and success at appealing repurchase 

requests differ from past experience, Fifth Third could have 

increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on 

repurchases, requiring material additions to the repurchase reserve.  
 If Fifth Third does not adjust to rapid changes in the financial 
services industry, its financial performance may suffer. 
Fifth Third™s ability to deliver strong financial performance and 

returns on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its 

ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the 

needs and demands of its customers. In addition to the challenge of 
competing against other banks in attracting and retaining customers 
for traditional banking services, Fifth Third™s competitors also 
include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment 

advisors, specialty finance and insurance companies who seek to 

offer one-stop financial services that may include services that banks 

have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past 

or may not be currently able or allowed to offer. This increasingly 

competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in 

regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, as 
well as the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial 
service providers. 
 If Fifth Third is unable to grow its deposits, it may be subject 
to paying higher funding costs. 
The total amount that Fifth Third pays for funding costs is 

dependent, in part, on Fifth Third™s ability to grow its deposits. If 

Fifth Third is unable to sufficiently grow its deposits to meet 
liquidity objectives, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs.  
Fifth Third competes with banks and other financial services 
companies for deposits. If competitors raise the rates they pay on 
deposits, Fifth Third™s funding costs may increase, either because 

Fifth Third raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because Fifth 

Third loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of 

funding. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin and 

net interest income. Fifth Third™s bank customers could take their 
money out of the bank and put it in alternative investments, causing 
Fifth Third to lose a lower cost source of funding. Checking and 

savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may 

decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as 

the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. 
  The Bancorp™s ability to receive dividends from its 
subsidiaries accounts for most of its revenue and could affect 
its liquidity and ability to pay dividends. 
  Fifth Third Bancorp is a separate and distinct legal entity from its 

subsidiaries. Fifth Third Bancorp typically receives substantially all 
of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends 
are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on Fifth Third 

Bancorp™s stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various 

federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory 

expectations, limit the amount of dividends that the Bancorp™s 
banking subsidiary and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. 
Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and 
insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased since the 
financial crisis and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all 

aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other 

distributions to shareholders of banks such as the parent bank 

holding companies. Also, Fifth Third Bancorp™s right to participate 

in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary™s liquidation or 
reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary™s 
creditors. Limitations on the Bancorp™s ability to receive dividends 
from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its 
liquidity and ability to pay dividends on stock or interest and 

principal on its debt. 

 The financial services industry is highly competitive and 
creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect Fifth 
Third™s revenue and profitability.  
 The financial services industry in which Fifth Third operates is 

highly competitive. Fifth Third competes not only with commercial 
banks, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge 
funds, and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., 

globally and over the internet. Fifth Third competes on the basis of 

several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue 

generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, 
reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial 
services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions 

involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired 
by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in 
Fifth Third™s competitors gaining greater capital and other 

resources, such as a broader range of products and services and 

geographic diversity. Fifth Third may experience pricing pressures 

as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to 
increase market share by reducing prices. 
 Fifth Third and/or the holders of its securities could be 
adversely affected by unfavorable ratings from rating agencies. 
 Fifth Third™s ability to access the capital markets is important to its 

overall funding profile. This access is affected by the ratings 

assigned by rating agencies to Fifth Third, certain of its subsidiaries 
and particular classes of securities they issue. The interest rates that 
Fifth Third pays on its securities are also influenced by, among 
other things, the credit ratings that it, its subsidiaries and/or its 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  30  Fifth Third Bancorp 
securities receive from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to 
Fifth Third or its subsidiaries™ credit rating could affect its ability to 

access the capital markets, increase its borrowing costs and 

negatively impact its profitability. A ratings downgrade to Fifth 
Third, its subsidiaries or their securities could also create obligations 
or liabilities to Fifth Third under the terms of its outstanding 
securities that could increase Fifth Third™s costs or otherwise have a 

negative effect on its results of operations or financial condition. 

Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular 

security issued by Fifth Third or its subsidiaries could negatively 

affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities 

and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.  
 Fifth Third could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled 
personnel. 
Fifth Third™s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract 

and retain key individuals. Competition for qualified candidates in 

the activities and markets that Fifth Third serves is great and Fifth 
Third may not be able to hire these candidates and retain them. If 
Fifth Third is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, Fifth 
Third may be unable to execute its business strategies and may 
suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations and financial 

condition. In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued joint 
guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a 

banking organization™s incentive compensation policies do not 
encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety 
and soundness of the organization. In addition, the DFA requires 
those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to require 
reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain 

compensation arrangements. The federal banking agencies and the 

SEC proposed such rules in April 2011. In addition, in June 2012, 

the SEC issued final rules to implement DFA™s requirement that the 
SEC direct the national securities exchanges to adopt certain listing 
standards related to the compensation committee of a company's 

board of directors as well as its compensation advisers. If Fifth 
Third is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at 
rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if 

compensation costs required to attract and retain employees 

become more expensive, Fifth Third™s performance, including its 

competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.  

 Fifth Third™s mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from 
quarter to quarter. 
Fifth Third earns revenue from the fees it receives for originating 

mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. When rates rise, 

the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall, reducing the revenue 

Fifth Third receives from loan originations. At the same time, 
revenue from MSRs can increase through increases in fair value. 
When rates fall, mortgage originations tend to increase and the value 

of MSRs tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. 

Even though the origination of mortgage loans can act as a ﬁnatural 
hedge,ﬂ the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For 
example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair 

value of residential MSRs is immediate, but any offsetting revenue 

benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to the new 

loans would accrue over time. It is also possible that even if interest 

rates were to fall, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase 

in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease 

in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates.  
     Fifth Third typically uses derivatives and other instruments to 
hedge its mortgage banking interest rate risk. Fifth Third generally 

does not hedge all of its risks, and the fact that Fifth Third attempts 

to hedge any of the risks does not mean Fifth Third will be 
successful. Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated 
models and constant monitoring. Fifth Third may use hedging 
instruments tied to U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR or Eurodollars that 

may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. 

Fifth Third could incur significant losses from its hedging activities. 
There may be periods where Fifth Third elects not to use derivatives 
and other instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk.  

 Fifth Third uses financial models for business planning 
purposes that may not adequately predict future results. 
Fifth Third uses financial models to aid in its planning for various 

purposes including its capital and liquidity needs, potential charge- 

offs, reserves, and other purposes. The models used may not 
accurately account for all variables that could affect future results, 
may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or 
understate certain effects. As a result of these potential failures, 
Fifth Third may not adequately prepare for future events and may 

suffer losses or other setbacks due to these failures. 

 Changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of MSRs.
 Fifth Third acquires MSRs when it keeps the servicing rights after 
the sale or securitization of the loans that have been originated or 
when it purchases the servicing rights to mortgage loans originated 

by other lenders. Fifth Third initially measures all residential MSRs 
at fair value and subsequently amortizes the MSRs in proportion to, 
and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. Fair value is 

the present value of estimated future net servicing income, 

calculated based on a number of variables, including assumptions 

about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. Servicing rights 
are assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with 
temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance 
and permanent impairment recognized through a write-off of the 
servicing asset and related valuation allowance. 
Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions 
and thus fair value. When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually 

more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a 

lower rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value 
of MSRs can decrease. Each quarter Fifth Third evaluates the fair 
value of MSRs, and decreases in fair value below amortized cost 
reduce earnings in the period in which the decrease occurs. 
 The preparation of Fifth Third™s financial statements requires 
the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity 

with U.S. GAAP requires management to make significant estimates 
that affect the financial statements. If new information arises that 
results in a material change to a reserve amount, such a change 

could result in a change to previously announced financial results. 
Refer to the ﬁCritical Accounting Policiesﬂ section of MD&A for 
more information regarding management™s significant estimates.  
 Changes in accounting standards or interpretations could 
impact Fifth Third™s reported earnings and financial 
condition. The accounting standard setters, including the FASB, the SEC and 
other regulatory agencies, periodically change the financial 

accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of 

Fifth Third™s consolidated financial statements. These changes can 
be hard to predict and can materially impact how Fifth Third 
records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. 

In some cases, Fifth Third could be required to apply a new or 
revised standard retroactively, which would result in the recasting of 
Fifth Third™s prior period financial statements.  
 MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 31  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Future acquisitions may dilute current shareholders™ 
ownership of Fifth Third and may cause Fifth Third to 
become more susceptible to adverse economic events. 
Subject to requisite regulatory approvals, future business 

acquisitions could be material to Fifth Third and it may issue 

additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would 
dilute current shareholders™ ownership interests. Acquisitions also 
could require Fifth Third to use substantial cash or other liquid 
assets or to incur debt. In those events, Fifth Third could become 
more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive 

pressures. 

 Difficulties in combining the op
erations of acquired entities 
with Fifth Third™s own operations may prevent Fifth Third 
from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions. 
Upon receipt of requisite governmental approvals and 
consummation of such transactions, inherent uncertainties exist 

when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. Fifth Third 

may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned 

operating efficiencies in an acquisition. In addition, the markets and 

industries in which Fifth Third and its potential acquisition targets 

operate are highly competitive. Fifth Third may lose customers or 
the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. 
Future acquisition and integration activities may require Fifth Third 

to devote substantial time and resources and as a result Fifth Third 

may not be able to pursue other business opportunities.   
After completing an acquisition, Fifth Third may find certain 
items are not accounted for properly in accordance with financial 

accounting and reporting standards. Fifth Third may also not realize 

the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial 
results pertaining to the acquired entity. For example, Fifth Third 
could experience higher charge-offs than originally anticipated 

related to the acquired loan portfolio.  Fifth Third may sell or consider selling one or more of its 
businesses. Should it determine to sell such a business, it may 
not be able to generate gains on sale or related increase in 
shareholders™ equity commensurate with desirable levels. 
Moreover, if Fifth Third sold such businesses, the loss of 
income could have an adverse effect on its earnings and future 
growth. Fifth Third owns, or owns a minority stake in, as applicable, several 

non-strategic businesses that are not significantly synergistic with its 

core financial services businesses. Fifth Third has, from time to 

time, considered the sale of such businesses and/or interests, 
including, for example, portions of our stake in Vantiv Holding, 
LLC. If it were to determine to sell such businesses and/or interests, 
Fifth Third would be subject to market forces that may make 

completion of a sale unsuccessful or may not be able to do so 

within a desirable time frame. If Fifth Third were to complete the 

sale of non-core businesses and/or interests, it would suffer the loss 

of income from the sold businesses and/or interests, including 

those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and 

such loss of income could have an adverse effect on its future 
earnings and growth.  Fifth Third relies on its systems and certain service providers, 
and certain failures could materially adversely affect 
operations. 
Fifth Third collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by 

utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks 

operated by both Fifth Third and third party service providers. Fifth 
Third has security, backup and recovery systems in place, as well as 
a business continuity plan to ensure the systems will not be 
inoperable. Fifth Third also has security to prevent unauthorized 
access to the systems. In addition, Fifth Third requires its third party 

service providers to maintain similar controls. However, Fifth Third 

cannot be certain that the measures will be successful. A security 

breach in the systems and loss of confidential information such as 

credit card numbers and related information could result in losing 
the customers™ confidence and thus the loss of their business as well 
as additional significant costs for privacy monitoring activities.  
Fifth Third™s necessary dependence upon automated systems to 
record and process its transaction volume poses the risk that 

technical system flaws or employee errors, tampering or 

manipulation of those systems will result in losses and may be 

difficult to detect. Fifth Third may also be subject to disruptions of 
its operating systems arising from events that are beyond its control 
(for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications 
outages). Fifth Third is further exposed to the risk that its third 
party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual 

obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or 

operational errors as Fifth Third). These disruptions may interfere 

with service to Fifth Third™s customers and result in a financial loss 
or liability.  Fifth Third is exposed to cyber-security risks, including denial 
of service, hacking, and identity theft.  
Fifth Third relies heavily on communications and information 

systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach 

in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its 
accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect 
our customer relationships. While Fifth Third has policies and 

procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible 
events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption 
or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be 

sufficiently remediated. There have been increasing efforts on the 

part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data 

security at financial institutions or with respect to financial 
transactions. There have been several recent instances involving 
financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the 

unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the 
destruction or theft of corporate data, by both private individuals 
and foreign governments. In addition, because the techniques used 

to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not 

recognized until launched against a target and may originate from 
less regulated and remote areas around the world, Fifth Third may 
be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement 

adequate preventative measures. Furthermore, there has been a well-

publicized series of apparently related distributed denial of service 
attacks on large financial services companies, including Fifth Third 
Bank. Distributed denial of service attacks are designed to saturate 

the targeted online network with excessive amounts of network 

traffic, resulting in slow response times, or in some cases, causing 
the site to be temporarily unavailable. To date these attacks have not 
been intended to steal financial data, but meant to interrupt or 

suspend a company™s Internet service. These events did not result in 

a breach of Fifth Third™s client data and account information 
remained secure; however, the attacks did adversely affect the 
performance of Fifth Third™s website and in some instances 

prevented customers from accessing Fifth Third™s website. While 
the event was resolved in a timely fashion and primarily resulted in 
inconvenience to our customers, future cyber-attacks could be more 

disruptive and damaging. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and 

Fifth Third may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. 

Fifth Third may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these 
risks or in the investigation of such cyber-attacks or related to the 
protection of the Bancorp™s customers from identity theft as a result 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  32  Fifth Third Bancorp 
of such attacks. Nevertheless, the occurrence of any failure, 
interruption or security breach of our systems, or of our third-party 

service providers, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial 

losses to customers, could also seriously damage Fifth Third™s 
reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to 
additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and 
financial liability. 

 Fifth Third is exposed to operational and reputational risk. 
Fifth Third is exposed to many types of operational risk, including 

but not limited to, business continuity risk, information 

management risk, fraud risk, model risk, third party service provider 
risk, human resources risk, and process risk.  
 Negative public opinion can result from Fifth Third™s actual or 
alleged conduct in activities, such as lending practices, data security, 
corporate governance and acquisitions, and may damage Fifth 

Third™s reputation. Additionally, actions taken by government 

regulators and community organizations may also damage Fifth 

Third™s reputation. This negative public opinion can adversely affect 

Fifth Third™s ability to attract and keep customers and can expose it 
to litigation and regulatory action.  
 The results of Vantiv Holding, LLC could have a negative 
impact on Fifth Third™s operating results and financial 
condition. In 2009, Fifth Third sold an approximate 51% interest in its 
processing business, Vantiv Holding, LLC (formerly Fifth Third 

Processing Solutions). As a result of additional share sales 
completed by Fifth Third in 2012, 2013 and 2014 the Bancorp™s 
current ownership share in Vantiv Holding, LLC is approximately 
23%. The Bancorp™s investment in Vantiv Holding, LLC is 
accounted for under the equity method of accounting and is not 

consolidated based on Fifth Third™s remaining ownership share in 

Vantiv Holding, LLC. Vantiv Holding, LLC™s operating results 

could be poor or favorable and could affect the operating results of 

Fifth Third. In addition, Fifth Third participates in a multi-lender 
credit facility to Vantiv Holding, LLC and repayment of these loans 
is contingent on future cash flows from Vantiv Holding, LLC.  

 Weather related events or other natural disasters may have an 
effect on the performance of 
Fifth Third™s loan portfolios, 
especially in its coastal markets, thereby adversely impacting 
its results of operations. 
Fifth Third™s footprint stretches from the upper Midwestern to 
lower Southeastern regions of the United States. This area has 
experienced weather events including hurricanes and other natural 

disasters. The nature and level of these events and the impact of 

global climate change upon their frequency and severity cannot be 
predicted. If large scale events occur, they may significantly impact 
its loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral as 

well as impairing its borrowers™ ability to repay their loans. 

 RISKS RELATED TO THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY 
ENVIRONMENT 

 As a regulated entity, the Bancorp is subject to certain capital 
requirements that may limit its operations and potential 
growth.   The Bancorp is a bank holding company and a financial holding 

company. As such, it is subject to the comprehensive, consolidated 
supervision and regulation of the FRB, including risk-based and 
leverage capital requirements, investment practices, dividend policy 
and growth. The Bancorp must maintain certain risk-based and 
leverage capital ratios as required by the FRB which can change 

depending upon general economic conditions and the Bancorp™s 
particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. Compliance with 
the capital requirements, including leverage ratios, may limit 

operations that require the intensive use of capital and could 

adversely affect the Bancorp™s ability to expand or maintain present 
business levels. In June 2012, Federal banking agencies proposed 
enhancements to the regulatory capital requirements for U.S. 
banking organizations, which implemented aspects of Basel III, 

such as re-defining the regulatory capital elements and minimum 

capital ratios, introducing regulatory capital buffers above those 

minimums, revising the agencies™ rules for calculating risk-weighted 
assets and introducing a new Tier I common equity ratio. In July 
2013, the Federal banking agencies issued final rules for the 
enhanced regulatory capital requirements, which included 
modifications to the proposed rules. The final rules provide the 

option for certain banking organizations, including the Bancorp, to 

opt out of including AOCI in Tier I capital and retain the treatment 

of residential mortgage exposures consistent with the current Basel I 

capital rules. The new capital rules are effective for the Bancorp on 
January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain components 
and other provisions. The need to maintain more and higher quality 
capital as well as greater liquidity going forward could limit our 
business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand, 

either organically or through acquisitions. Moreover, although these 

new requirements are being phased in over time, U.S. Federal 

banking agencies have been taking into account expectations 
regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, 
including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that 
represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases and share 
repurchases.  The Bancorp™s banking subsidiary must remain well-capitalized, 
well-managed and maintain at least a ﬁSatisfactoryﬂ CRA rating for 

the Bancorp to retain its status as a financial holding company. 

Failure to meet these requirements could result in the FRB placing 
limitations or conditions on the Bancorp™s activities (and the 
commencement of new activities) and could ultimately result in the 
loss of financial holding company status. In addition, failure by the 
Bancorp™s banking subsidiary to meet applicable capital guidelines 

could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies 

available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include 

limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the 

regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital, and the 

termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.  

 Fifth Third™s business, financial condition and results of 
operations could be adversely affected by new or changed 
regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are 
applied by regulatory authorities. 
 Previous economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, 

have resulted in government regulatory agencies placing increased 

focus on and scrutiny of the financial services industry. The U.S. 
government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding 
to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis, by 
introducing various actions and passing legislation such as the DFA. 
Such programs and legislation subject Fifth Third and other 

financial institutions to restrictions, oversight and/or costs that may 

have an impact on Fifth Third™s business, financial condition, results 

of operations or the price of its common stock.  
New proposals for legislation and regulations continue to be 
introduced that could further substantially increase regulation of the 
financial services industry. Fifth Third cannot predict whether any 
pending or future legislation will be adopted or the substance and 
impact of any such new legislation on Fifth Third. Additional 

regulation could affect Fifth Third in a substantial way and could 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 33  Fifth Third Bancorp 
have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and 
results of operations.    
 Fifth Third is subject to various regulatory requirements that 
may limit its operations and potential growth. 
Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety 
and soundness of insured depository institutions and their holding 
companies, the FRB, the FDIC, the CFPB and the Ohio Division of 

Financial Institutions have the authority to compel or restrict certain 

actions by Fifth Third and its banking subsidiary. Fifth Third and its 
banking subsidiary are subject to such supervisory authority and, 
more generally, must, in certain instances, obtain prior regulatory 

approval before engaging in certain activities or corporate decisions. 

There can be no assurance that such approvals, if required, would 
be forthcoming or that such approvals would be granted in a timely 
manner. Failure to receive any such approval, if required, could limit 

or impair Fifth Third™s operations, restrict its growth and/or affect 

its dividend policy. Such actions and activities subject to prior 
approval include, but are not limited to, increasing dividends paid by 
Fifth Third or its banking subsidiary, entering into a merger or 

acquisition transaction, acquiring or establishing new branches, and 

entering into certain new businesses. 
 In addition, Fifth Third, as well as other financial institutions 
more generally, have recently been subjected to increased scrutiny 

from government authorities, including bank regulatory authorities, 
stemming from broader systemic regulatory concerns, including 
with respect to stress testing, capital levels, asset quality, 

provisioning, AML/BSA, consumer compliance and other 

prudential matters and efforts to ensure that financial institutions 

take steps to improve their risk management and prevent future 
crises. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank 
regulatory agencies, are also pursuing aggressive enforcement 

actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving 
financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual 
and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect our 

ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain 

activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection 

therewith.  In some cases, regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions 
that may not be publicly disclosed, which restrict or limit a financial 
institution. Finally, as part of Fifth Third™s regular examination 
process, Fifth Third™s and its banking subsidiary™s respective 

regulators may advise it and its banking subsidiary to operate under 

various restrictions as a prudential matter. Such supervisory actions 

or restrictions, if and in whatever manner imposed, could have a 

material adverse effect on Fifth Third™s business and results of 
operations and may not be publicly disclosed. 
 Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become involved 
from time to time in information-gathering requests, 
investigations and proceedings by various governmental 
regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well 
as self-regulatory agencies which may lead to adverse 
consequences. 
Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become involved from 

time to time in information-gathering requests, reviews, 

investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by 

governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, 
as well as self-regulatory agencies, regarding their respective 
businesses. Such matters may result in material adverse 

consequences, including without limitation, adverse judgments, 

settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other actions, 
amendments and/or restatements of Fifth Third™s SEC filings 
and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of 
material weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures. 
  Deposit insurance premiums levied against Fifth Third Bank 
may increase if the number of bank failures increase or the 
cost of resolving failed banks increases.  
The FDIC maintains a DIF to protect insured depositors in the 

event of bank failures. The DIF is funded by fees assessed on 

insured depository institutions including Fifth Third Bank. Future 
deposit premiums paid by Fifth Third Bank depend on the level of 
the DIF and the magnitude and cost of future bank failures. Fifth 

Third Bank may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC 

premiums if market developments change such that the DIF 

balance is reduced.  
 Legislative or regulatory compliance, changes or actions or 
significant litigation, could adversely impact Fifth Third or the 
businesses in which Fifth Third is engaged. 
 Fifth Third is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, 

supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its 
operations and limit the businesses in which Fifth Third may 
engage. These laws and regulations may change from time to time 
and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers and 
depositors. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or 

other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact Fifth 

Third or its ability to increase the value of its business. Additionally, 

actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against Fifth 

Third could cause it to devote significant time and resources to 
defending itself and may lead to penalties that materially affect Fifth 
Third and its shareholders. Future changes in the laws, including tax 
laws, or regulations or their interpretations or enforcement may also 
be materially adverse to Fifth Third and its shareholders or may 

require Fifth Third to expend significant time and resources to 

comply with such requirements. On July 21, 2010 the President of the United States signed into 
law the DFA. Many parts of the DFA are now in effect, while 
others are in an implementation stage likely to continue for several 

years. A number of reform provisions are likely to significantly 
impact the ways in which banks and bank holding companies, 
including Fifth Third and its bank subsidiary, conduct their 

business: The CFPB has been given authority to regulate 
consumer financial products and services sold by 
banks and non-bank companies and to supervise 

banks with assets of more than $10 billion and their 

affiliates for compliance with Federal consumer 

protection laws. Any new regulatory requirements 

promulgated by the CFPB could require changes to 
our consumer businesses, result in increased 
compliance costs and affect the streams of revenue of 

such businesses. The FSOC has been charged with 

identifying systemic risks, promoting stronger 

financial regulation and identifying those non-bank 

companies that are systemically important and thus 
should be subject to regulation by the Federal 

Reserve.  The DFA ﬁVolcker Ruleﬂ provisions and 
implementing final rule generally prohibit any 
banking entity from (i) engaging in short-term 
proprietary trading for its own account and (ii) 

sponsoring or acquiring ownership interests in 
private equity or hedge funds. The Volcker Rule, 
however, contains a number of exceptions to these 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  34  Fifth Third Bancorp 
prohibitions. For example, transactions on behalf of 
customers or in connection with certain underwriting 

and market making activities, as well as risk-

mitigating hedging activities and certain foreign 
banking activities are permitted. The risk-mitigating 
hedging exemption applies to hedging activities that 
are designed to reduce or significantly mitigate 

specific, identifiable risks of individual or aggregated 

positions. Fifth Third is required to conduct an 

analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the 

effectiveness of hedges must be monitored and 

recalibrated as necessary. Fifth Third will be required 
to document, contemporaneously with the 
transaction, the hedging rationale for certain 
transactions that present heighted compliance risks. 

Under the market-making exemption, a trading desk 

is required to routinely stand ready to purchase and 

sell one or more types of financial instruments. The 
trading desk™s inventory in these types of financial 
instruments has to be designed not to exceed, on an 
ongoing basis, the reasonably expected near-term 
demands of customers. The Volcker Rule and the rulemakings promulgated 
thereunder restrict banks and their affiliated entities 
from investing in or sponsoring certain private equity 
and hedge funds.  Fifth Third does not sponsor any 

private equity or hedge funds that it is prohibited 
from sponsoring.  As of December 31, 2014, the 

Bancorp had approximately $165 million in interests 

and approximately $60 million in binding 

commitments to invest in private equity funds likely 
to be affected by the Volcker rule. It is expected that 
the Bancorp may need to eliminate these investments 
although it is likely that these investments will be 

reduced over time in the ordinary course before 

compliance is required. In December 2014, the FRB 

extended the conformance period through July 2016 

for investments in and relationships with such 
covered funds that were in place prior to December 
31, 2013, and indicated that it intends to further 
extend the compliance period for such investments 
through July 2017. An ultimate forced sale of some 

of these investments could result in Fifth Third 

receiving less value than it would otherwise have 

received. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve adopted a final 
rule that requires bank holding companies that have 
$50 billion or more in assets, like Fifth Third, to 

periodically submit to the Federal Reserve, the FDIC 
and the FSOC a plan discussing how the company 
could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion if the 

company were to fail or experience material financial 
distress. In a related rulemaking, the FDIC adopted a 
final rule that requires insured depository institutions 

with $50 billion or more in assets, like Fifth Third, to 

annually prepare and submit a resolution plan to the 

FDIC, which would include, among other things, an 
analysis of how the institution could be resolved 
under the FDIA in a manner that protects depositors 

and limits losses or costs to creditors of the bank. 

Initial plans for Fifth Third and its bank subsidiary 

have been submitted, in accordance with the final 
regulatory rules, for review by the FDIC, the Federal 
Reserve, and the FSOC. The Federal Reserve and the 

FDIC may jointly impose restrictions on Fifth Third 

or its bank subsidiary, including additional capital 
requirements or limitations on growth, if the agencies 
determine that the institution™s plan is not credible or 
would not facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution of 
Fifth Third under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or Fifth 

Third Bank under the FDIA, and additionally could 

require Fifth Third to divest assets or take other 

actions if it did not submit an acceptable resolution 

within two years after any such restrictions were 
imposed. Title VII of DFA imposes a new regulatory regime 
on the U.S. derivatives markets. While most of the 
provisions related to derivatives markets are now in 
effect, several additional requirements await final 

regulations from the relevant regulatory agencies for 
derivatives, the CFTC and the SEC. One aspect of 
this new regulatory regime for derivatives is that 

substantial oversight responsibility has been provided 

to the CFTC, which, as a result, now has a 

meaningful supervisory role with respect to some of 
Fifth Third™s businesses. In 2014, Fifth Third Bank 
registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and 

became subject to new substantive requirements, 
including real time trade reporting and robust record 
keeping requirements, business conduct requirements 

(including daily valuations, disclosure of material risks 

associated with swaps and disclosure of material 

incentives and conflicts of interest), and mandatory 
clearing and exchange trading of all standardized 
swaps designated by the relevant regulatory agencies 
as required to be cleared. Although the ultimate 
impact will depend on the promulgation of all final 

regulations, Fifth Third‚s derivatives business will 

likely be further subject to new substantive 

requirements, including margin requirements in 

excess of current market practice and capital 
requirements specific to this business. These 
requirements will collectively impose implementation 
and ongoing compliance burdens on Fifth Third and 

will introduce additional legal risk (including as a 

result of newly applicable antifraud and anti-

manipulation provisions and private rights of action). 

Once finalized, the rules may raise the costs and 
liquidity burden associated with Fifth Third™s 
derivatives businesses and adversely affect or cause 
Fifth Third to change its derivatives products. Financial institutions may be required, regardless of 
risk, to pay taxes or other fees to the U.S. Treasury. 
Such taxes or other fees could be designed to 

reimburse the U.S. Treasury for the many 
government programs and initiatives it has taken or 
may undertake as part of its economic stimulus 

efforts. The Department of Treasury issued an 

interim final rule in 2012 to establish an assessment 
schedule for the collection of fees from bank holding 
companies with at least $50 billion in assets and 

foreign banks with at least $50 billion in assets in the 

U.S. to cover the expenses of the Office of Financial 

Research and FSOC. In August 2013, the FRB also 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 35  Fifth Third Bancorp 
adopted a final rule to implement an assessment 
provision under the DFA equal to the expense the 

FRB estimates are necessary or appropriate to 

supervise and regulate bank holding companies with 

$50 billion or more in assets.  
On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Columbia issued an order granting 
summary judgment to the plaintiffs in a case 
challenging certain provisions of the FRB™s rule 
concerning electronic debit card transaction fees and 

network exclusivity arrangements (the ﬁCurrent 
Ruleﬂ) that were adopted to implement Section 1075 

of the DFA, known as the Durbin Amendment. The 

Court held that, in adopting the Current Rule, the 
FRB violated the Durbin Amendment™s provisions 

concerning which costs are allowed to be taken into 
account for purposes of setting fees that are 
reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by 

the issuer and therefore the Current Rule™s maximum 

permissible fees were too high. In addition, the Court 

held that the Current Rule™s network non-exclusivity 

provisions concerning unaffiliated payment networks 

for debit cards also violated the Durbin Amendment. 

The Court vacated the Current Rule, but stayed its 
ruling to provide the FRB an opportunity to replace 
the invalidated portions. The FRB appealed this 
decision and on March 21, 2014, the D.C. Circuit 
Court of Appeals reversed the District Court™s grant 

of summary judgment and remanded the case for 

further proceedings in accordance with its opinion. 

The merchants have filed a petition for writ of 

certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. However, on 
January 20, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to 
hear an appeal of the Circuit Court reversal, thereby 
largely upholding the Current Rule and substantially 

reducing uncertainty surrounding debit card 

interchange fees the Bancorp is permitted to charge. 

Refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the 

Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A for 
further information regarding the Bancorp™s debit 
card interchange revenue.  
It is clear that the reforms, both under the DFA and otherwise, are 
having a significant effect on the entire financial industry. Fifth 

Third believes compliance with the DFA and implementing its 

regulations and other initiatives will likely continue to negatively 

impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business, both in 

terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also 

limit Fifth Third™s ability to pursue certain desirable business 
opportunities. Any new regulatory requirements or changes to 
existing requirements could require changes to Fifth Third™s 

businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the 

profitability of such businesses. Additionally, reform could affect 

the behaviors of third parties that we deal with in the course of our 

business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and 

investors. The extent to which Fifth Third can adjust its strategies to 

offset such adverse impacts also is not known at this time.  
 Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become the subject 
of litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to 
Fifth Third™s reputation.  
Fifth Third and certain of its directors and officers have been 

named from time to time as defendants in various class actions and 
other litigation relating to Fifth Third™s business and activities. Past, 
present and future litigation have included or could include claims 

for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for 

indeterminate amounts of damages. The SEC has announced a 

policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, 

which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. These 
matters could result in material adverse judgments, settlements, 
fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief, amendments and/or 
restatements of Fifth Third™s SEC filings and/or financial 

statements, as applicable and/or determinations of material 
weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures.  Like other 

large financial institutions and companies, Fifth Third is also subject 

to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-
compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of 
confidential information. Substantial legal liability or significant 
regulatory action against Fifth Third could materially adversely 
affect its business, financial condition or results of operations 

and/or cause significant reputational harm to its business. 

 Fifth Third™s ability to pay or increase dividends on its 
common stock or to repurchase its capital stock is restricted. 
Fifth Third™s ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock is subject 
to regulatory requirements and the need to meet regulatory 
expectations. Fifth Third is subject to an annual assessment by the 

FRB as part of CCAR. The mandatory elements of the capital plan 

are an assessment of the expected use and sources of capital over 
the planning horizon, a description of all planned capital actions 
over the planning horizon, a discussion of any expected changes to 

the Bancorp™s business plan that are likely to have a material impact 

on its capital adequacy or liquidity, a detailed description of the 
Bancorp™s process for assessing capital adequacy and the Bancorp™s 
capital policy. The capital plan must reflect the revised capital 

framework that the FRB adopted in connection with the 
implementation of the Basel III accord, including the framework™s 
minimum regulatory capital ratios and transition arrangements. Fifth 

Third™s stress testing results and 2015 capital plan were submitted to 

the FRB on January 5, 2015. 
The FRB™s review of the capital plan will assess the 
comprehensiveness of the capital plan, the reasonableness of the 
assumptions and the analysis underlying the capital plan. 
Additionally, the FRB will review the robustness of the capital 
adequacy process, the capital policy and the Bancorp™s ability to 

maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and 

above a Tier I common ratio of 5 percent under baseline and 

stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS 
Net Interest Income 
Net interest income is the interest earned on securities, loans and 
leases (including yield-related fees) and other interest-earning assets 
less the interest paid for core deposits (includes transaction deposits 

and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates 
of deposit $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds 
purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The 

net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by 

average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the 

difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning 
assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net 
interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due 
to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by 
noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand 

deposits or shareholders™ equity. 
Table 8 presents the components of net interest income, net 
interest margin and net interest rate spread for the years ended 

December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Nonaccrual loans and leases 
and loans held for sale have been included in the average loan and 
lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on 

amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses on available-for-

sale securities included in other assets. Table 9 provides the relative 

impact of changes in the balance sheet and changes in interest rates 

on net interest income.  
Net interest income was $3.6 billion for both the years ended 
December 31, 2014 and 2013. Net interest income was positively 
impacted by an increase in average taxable securities of $5.4 billion 
for the year ended December 31, 2014 coupled with an increase in 
yields on these securities of 16 bps for the year ended December 31, 

2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Net interest 

income also included the benefit of an increase in average loans and 

leases of $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, as well 

as a decrease in the rates paid on long-term debt for the year ended 
December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 
2013. These benefits were partially offset by lower yields on loans 
and leases and an increase in average long-term debt of $5.0 billion 

for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended 

December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net 

interest rate spread decreased to 2.94% from 3.15% in 2013 driven 

by a 21 bps decrease in yields on average interest-earning assets for 
the year ended December 31, 2014. 
Net interest margin was 3.10% for the year ended December 
31, 2014 compared to 3.32% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease from December 31, 2013 was driven primarily by the 

previously mentioned decrease in the net interest rate spread, 

partially offset by increases in average free funding balances.  
Interest income from loans and leases decreased $148 million, 
or four percent, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 
primarily due to a decrease of 25 bps in yields on average loans and 
leases partially offset by an increase of two percent in average loans 
and leases for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the 
year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in average loans and 

leases for the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven primarily 

by an increase of nine percent in average commercial and industrial 

loans partially offset by a decrease in average residential mortgage 

loans of eight percent compared to the year ended December 31, 
2013. For more information on the Bancorp™s loan and lease 
portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance 
Sheet Analysis section of MD&A. Interest income from investment 
securities and other short-term investments increased $206 million 

compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 driven by the 

factors discussed above.  
Average core deposits increased $6.8 billion, or eight percent, 
compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to an 
increase in average money market deposits, average interest 
checking deposits and average demand deposits, partially offset by a 
decrease in average savings deposits. The cost of average interest 
bearing core deposits was 27 bps for both the years ended 

December 31, 2014 and 2013. Interest expense on money market 

deposits increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 

compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 driven by a $5.2 

billion increase in average money market deposits and a 10 bps 

increase in the rate paid on average money market deposits. This 

increase was partially offset by a decrease of 27 bps in the rate paid 
on other time deposits for the year ended December 31, 2014 
compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Refer to the 

Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of 

MD&A for additional information on the Bancorp™s deposits. 
Interest expense on average wholesale funding for the year 
ended December 31, 2014 increased $23 million, or nine percent, 

compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an 

increase in interest expense related to long-term debt partially offset 
by a decrease in average certificates $100,000 and over. Interest 
expense on long-term debt increased during the year ended 

December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 
driven by a $5.0 billion increase in average long-term debt partially 
offset by a 67 bps decrease in the rate paid on long-term debt 

primarily due to the redemption of $750 million of outstanding 

TruPS during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the lower cost of new 

debt issuances in 2014. Interest expense on average certificates 
$100,000 and over decreased during the year ended December 31, 
2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 driven 

primarily by a $2.4 billion decrease in average certificates $100,000 
and over partially offset by a 7 bps increase in the rate paid on 
average certificates $100,000 and over. Refer to the Borrowings 

subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for 

additional information on the Bancorp™s borrowings. During both 

the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, wholesale funding 
represented 24% of average interest-bearing liabilities. For more 
information on the Bancorp™s interest rate risk management, 
including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest 
rates, refer to the Market Risk Management section of MD&A.

 Provision for Loan and Lease Losses 
The Bancorp provides as an expense an amount for probable loan 
and lease losses within the loan and lease portfolio that is based on 

factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies 
section. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL to a level 
deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses inherent in the 
portfolio. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged 
against the ALLL. The amount of loans actually removed from the 

Consolidated Balance Sheets is referred to as charge-offs. Net 

charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on 

previously charged-off loans and leases. The provision for loan and lease losses increased to $315 
million in 2014 compared to $229 million in 2013. The increase in 
provision expense for 2014 compared to the prior year was 
primarily due to an increase in net charge-offs related to certain 
impaired commercial and industrial loans in the first and third 

quarters of 2014 and an increase in net charge-offs related to the 
transfer of certain residential mortgage loans from the portfolio to 
held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2014. The impact of these 

increases in charge-offs on provision expense in 2014 was partially 

offset by decreases in nonperforming loans and leases and improved 
delinquency metrics. The ALLL declined $260 million from $1.6 
billion at December 31, 2013 to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2014. 

As of December 31, 2014, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio loans 
and leases decreased to 1.47%, compared to 1.79% at December 31, 
2013.  Refer to the Credit Risk Management section of MD&A as 
well as Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

for more detailed information on the provision for loan and lease 
losses, including an analysis of loan portfolio composition, 
nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and other factors considered 

by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease 
portfolio and the ALLL. MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   Service charges on deposits 
Service charges on deposits increased $11 million in 2014 compared 

to 2013. Commercial deposit revenue increased $15 million in 2014 
compared to 2013 primarily due to new customer acquisition and 
product expansion. Consumer deposit revenue decreased $4 million 
in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a decrease in consumer 
checking and savings fees from a decline in the percentage of 

consumer customers being charged service fees, partially offset by 

an increase in overdraft fees. 
 Corporate banking revenue Corporate banking revenue increased $30 million in 2014 compared 
to 2013. The increase from the prior year was primarily the result of 
an increase in syndication and lease remarketing fees. Syndication 

fees increased $22 million compared to 2013 due to the investment 
in resources in the commercial business and a strengthening 
economy in 2014. The increase in lease remarketing fees included 

the impact of a $9 million write-down of equipment value on an 
operating lease during the fourth quarter of 2013.  
 Investment advisory revenue Investment advisory revenue increased $14 million in 2014 

compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 

$15 million in private client service fees due to growth in personal 

asset management fees, partially offset by a decrease in securities 

broker fees due to a decline in transactional brokerage revenue. The 
Bancorp had approximately $308 billion and $302 billion in total 
assets under care as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, 
and managed $27 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and 
not-for-profit organizations as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.

   845 
   Origination fees and gains on loan sales decreased $300 million in 
2014 compared to 2013 primarily as the result of a 66% decrease in 

residential mortgage loan originations. Residential mortgage loan 

originations decreased to $7.5 billion in 2014 from $22.3 billion in 
2013 due to strong refinancing activity that occurred during the year 
ended December 31, 2013.  
Net mortgage servicing revenue is comprised of gross servicing 
fees and related servicing rights amortization as well as valuation 

adjustments on MSRs and mark-to-market adjustments on both 

settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial 

instruments used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio. Net 
servicing revenue decreased $90 million in 2014 compared to 2013 
driven primarily by a decrease of $132 million in net valuation 
adjustments, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage servicing 
rights amortization of $47 million.   
The net valuation adjustment gain of $30 million during 2014 
included $95 million in gains from derivatives economically hedging 
the MSRs partially offset by temporary impairment of $65 million 
on the MSRs. The net valuation adjustment gain of $162 million 

during 2013 included a recovery of temporary impairment of $192 

million on MSRs partially offset by $30 million in losses from 

derivatives economically hedging the MSRs. Mortgage rates 
decreased during 2014 which caused the modeled prepayments 
speeds to increase, which led to temporary impairment on servicing 
rights during the year. Mortgage rates increased in 2013 which 

caused the modeled prepayment speeds to slow, and led to the 

recovery of temporary impairment on servicing rights in 2013.  
Servicing rights are deemed impaired when a borrower™s loan 
rate is distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Impairment on 
servicing rights is reversed when the prevailing rates return to a level 
commensurate with the borrower™s loan rate. Further detail on the 
valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 11 of the Notes to 
Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-

qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk

associated with changes in the valuation on the MSR portfolio. 
Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to 

economically hedge the MSR portfolio. 
The Bancorp™s total residential loans serviced as of December 
31, 2014 and 2013 was $79.0 billion and $82.7 billion, respectively, 
with $65.4 billion and $69.2 billion, respectively, of residential 

mortgage loans serviced for others. 
In addition to the derivative positions used to economically 
hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as 

a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. The Bancorp 

did not sell securities related to the non-qualifying hedging strategy 
during the year ended December 31, 2014.  Net gains on the sale of 
these securities were $13 million during the year ended 2013, 
recorded in securities gains, net, non-qualifying hedges on mortgage 

servicing rights in the Bancorp™s Consolidated Statements of 

Income.   Card and processing revenue Card and processing revenue increased $23 million in 2014 
compared to 2013.  The increase was primarily the result of an 

increase in the number of actively used cards as well as higher 

processing fees related to additional ATM locations. Debit card 

interchange revenue, included in card and processing revenue, was 
$128 million and $122 million for the years ended December 31, 
2014 and 2013, respectively.

 Other noninterest income decreased $429 million in 2014 compared 
to 2013. The decrease included the impact of a gain of $125 million 

on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the second quarter of 2014 
compared to gains totaling $327 million during the second and third 
quarters of 2013. The Bancorp recognized gains of $23 million and 
$9 million associated with a tax receivable agreement with Vantiv, 
Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 

addition, the positive valuation adjustments on the stock warrant 

associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC were $31 million and $206 

million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, 

respectively. The fair value of the stock warrant is calculated using 
the Black-Scholes valuation model, which utilizes several key inputs 
(Vantiv, Inc. stock price, strike price of the warrant and several 
unobservable inputs). The positive valuation adjustments for the 

years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to 

increases of four percent and 60%, respectively, in Vantiv, Inc.™s 

share price from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 and 

from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013, respectively. 

Equity method earnings from the Bancorp™s interest in Vantiv 
Holding, LLC decreased $29 million from 2013 primarily due to 
charges taken by Vantiv Holding, LLC related to an acquisition in 

2014 and a decrease in the Bancorp™s ownership percentage of 

Vantiv Holding, LLC from approximately 25% at December 31, 
2013 to approximately 23% at December 31, 2014.  
Insurance income decreased $12 million in 2014 compared to 
2013 due to a decrease in premiums and fees collected in 2014. 

Additionally, the Bancorp recognized $38 million and $31 million in 

negative valuation adjustments related to the Visa total return swap 

for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For 

additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with 
the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares and the valuation of the warrant 
and put options associated with the sale of Vantiv Holding, LLC, 
refer to Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The ﬁotherﬂ caption decreased $20 million for the year ended 
2014 compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily the result of 

$20 million in impairment charges in 2014 for branches and land. 

For more information on these impairment charges, refer to Note 7 

of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense decreased $252 million, or six percent, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended Dec
ember 31, 2013, primarily due to decreases in total personnel costs (salaries, wages and incentives plus employee benefits) and other non
interest expense. 
The components of noninterest expense are as follows:

 Total personnel costs decreased $155 million, or eight percent, in 
2014 compared to 2013 driven by a decrease in incentive 
compensation primarily in the mortgage business due to lower 
production levels and a decrease in base compensation and 
employee benefits as a result of a decline in the number of full time 
equivalent employees in 2014. Full time equivalent employees 
totaled 18,351 at December 31, 2014 compared to 19,446 at

   1,374 
   Total other noninterest expense decreased $125 million, or 10%, in 
2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to decreases in loan and lease 

expense, FDIC insurance and other taxes, losses and adjustments, 

marketing expense, debt extinguishment costs and an increase in the 
benefit from the reserve for unfunded commitments, partially offset 
by increases in impairment on affordable housing investments.  
Loan and lease expense decreased $39 million in 2014 
compared to 2013 due to lower loan closing and appraisal costs 

driven by a decline in mortgage originations. FDIC insurance and 

other taxes decreased $38 million in 2014 compared to 2013 

primarily due to the change in the mix of the Bancorp™s funding 

base and higher capital levels, a change in tax laws during 2014 and 
the implementation of the large bank assessment fee, which 
included billings for prior periods during 2013. Losses and 
adjustments decreased $33 million in 2014 compared to 2013 
primarily due to a decrease in legal settlements and reserve expense. 

Marketing expense decreased $16 million in 2014 compared to 2013 

due to management™s expense control efforts. Debt extinguishment 
costs decreased $8 million in 2014 compared to 2013. During the 
fourth quarter of 2013, the Bancorp incurred $8 million of debt 

extinguishment costs associated with the redemption of outstanding 

TruPS issued by Fifth Third Capital Trust IV. The benefit from the 
reserve for unfunded commitments was $27 million and $17 million 
in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in the benefit 

recognized reflects a decrease in estimated loss rates related to 

unfunded commitments due to improved credit trends partially 

offset by an increase in unfunded commitments for which the 

Bancorp holds reserves. 
Impairment on affordable housing investments increased $27 
million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily driven by a $12 million 
benefit from the sale of affordable housing investments in 2013 and 
incremental losses on previous investments.  
The Bancorp continues to focus on efficiency initiatives as part 
of its core emphasis on operating leverage and expense control. The 
efficiency ratio (noninterest expense divided by the sum of net 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  42  Fifth Third Bancorp 
interest income (FTE) and noninterest income) was 61.1% for 2014 compared to 58.2% in 2013. 
 Applicable Income Taxes 
Applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the benefit 
from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, certain gains 
on sales of leveraged leases that are exempt from federal taxation 

and tax credits, partially offset by the effect of certain nondeductible 

expenses. The tax credits are associated with the Low-Income 
Housing Tax Credit program established under Section 42 of the 
IRC, the New Markets Tax Credit program established under 

Section 45D of the IRC, the Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit 

program established under Section 47 of the IRC and the Qualified 
Zone Academy Bond program established under Section 1397E of 
the IRC.  
The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2014 
and 2013 were primarily impacted by $164 million and $155 million, 

respectively, in tax credits, $27 million of tax benefit from tax 
exempt income in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and a $9 million 

non-cash charge to income tax expense related to stock-based 

awards during the year ended December 31, 2013. The Bancorp did 
not recognize a similar non-cash charge related to stock-based 
awards during the year ended December 31, 2014.  
As required under U.S. GAAP, the Bancorp established a 
deferred tax asset for stock-based awards granted to its employees 
and directors. When the actual tax deduction for these stock-based 

awards is less than the expense previously recognized for financial  

  reporting or when the awards expire unexercised and where the 

Bancorp has not accumulated an excess tax benefit for previously 
exercised or released stock-based awards, the Bancorp is required to 
recognize a non-cash charge to income tax expense upon the write-

off of the deferred tax asset previously established for these stock-

based awards. As a result of the expiration of certain stock options 

and SARs, the lapse of restrictions on certain shares of restricted 
stock and because the Bancorp did not have an accumulated excess 

tax benefit, the Bancorp was required to recognize a non-cash 
charge to income tax expense of $9 million for the write-off of the 
deferred tax asset previously established for these awards during the 
year ended December 31, 2013. Based on the accumulated excess 

tax benefit at December 31, 2014 the Bancorp was not required to 

recognize a non-cash charge to income tax expense related to stock-
based awards for the year ended December 31, 2014. 
Based on the Bancorp™s stock price at December 31, 2014 and 
the Bancorp™s accumulation of an excess tax benefit through the 

year ended December 31, 2014, the Bancorp does not believe it will 
be required to recognize a non-cash charge to income tax expense 
over the next twelve months related to stock-based awards. 

However, the Bancorp cannot predict its stock price or whether its 
employees will exercise other stock-based awards with lower 
exercise prices in the future.  Therefore, it is possible the Bancorp 

may need to recognize a non-cash charge to income tax expense in 

the future.  The Bancorp™s income before income taxes, applicable income tax expense and effective tax rate are as follows:

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 
The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial 
Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Investment 

Advisors. Additional detailed financial information on each business 
segment is included in Note 30 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp™s business segments 
are presented based on its management structure and management 

accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are 
specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the 

Bancorp™s business segments are not necessarily comparable with 

similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp 

refines its methodologies from time to time as management™s 
accounting practices or businesses change.  
The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the 
corporate level and employs a FTP methodology at the business 
segment level. This methodology insulates the business segments 

from interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving 

customers through loan and deposit products. The FTP system 

assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of assets and 
liabilities, respectively, based on expected duration and the U.S. 
swap curve. Matching duration allocates interest income and interest 
expense to each segment so its resulting net interest income is 
insulated from interest rate risk. In a rising rate environment, the 

Bancorp benefits from the widening spread between deposit costs 

and wholesale funding costs. However, the Bancorp™s FTP system 

credits this benefit to deposit-providing businesses, such as Branch 

Banking and Investment Advisors, on a duration-adjusted basis. The net impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General 
Corporate and Other.   
The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as 
dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning 

assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The credit rate provided for 
demand deposit accounts is reviewed annually based upon the 
account type, its estimated duration and the corresponding fed 
funds, U.S. swap curve or swap rate. The credit rates for several 
deposit products were reset January 1, 2014 to reflect the current 

market rates and updated duration assumptions. These rates were 

generally higher than those in place during 2013, thus net interest 

income for deposit providing businesses was positively impacted 

during 2014.  The business segments are charged provision expense based on 
the actual net charge-offs experienced on the loans and leases 
owned by each segment. Provision expense attributable to loan and 
lease growth and changes in ALLL factors are captured in General 

Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments 

include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. 

Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking 

advantage of cross-sell opportunities and when funding operations, 
by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.  
The results of operations and financial position for the years 
ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were adjusted to reflect the 

transfer of certain customers and Bancorp employees from Branch 

Banking to Commercial Banking, effective January 1, 2014. In 

addition, the 2013 and 2012 balances were adjusted to reflect a 

change in internal allocation methodology.

 Comparison of 2014 with 2013 Net income was $819 million for the year ended December 31, 

2014, compared to net income of $814 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2013. The increase in net income was the result of 
increases in net interest income and noninterest income, partially 

offset by increases in noninterest expense and the provision for loan 
and lease losses. Net interest income increased $61 million from the prior year 
primarily due to growth in average commercial construction loans, 

an increase in FTP credits due to an increase in demand deposits 

and a decrease in FTP charges, partially offset by a decline in yields 

of 29 bps on average commercial loans. 
Provision for loan and lease losses increased $41 million from 
the prior year due to an increase in net charge-offs related to certain 
impaired commercial and industrial loans in the first and third 
quarters of 2014. Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio 

loans and leases increased to 46 bps for 2014 compared to 41 bps 

for 2013.  
Noninterest income increased $69 million from the prior year 
due to increases in corporate banking revenue, service charges on 
deposits and other noninterest income. Corporate banking revenue 

increased $37 million from 2013 primarily driven by increases in 
syndication fees and lease remarketing fees. Service charges on 
deposits increased $19 million from 2013 primarily driven by higher 

commercial deposit revenue which increased due to the acquisition 

of new customers and product expansion. Other noninterest 
income increased $13 million from 2013 primarily due to increases 
in operating lease income and card and processing revenue. 
Noninterest expense increased $84 million from the prior year 
as a result of an increase in other noninterest expense, partially 
offset by a decrease in salaries, incentives and benefits. Other 
noninterest expense increased $88 million from 2013 driven by 
increases in corporate overhead allocations, impairment on 

affordable housing investments and operating lease expense. The 

decrease in salaries, incentives and employee benefits of $4 million 
was due to a decrease in incentive compensation resulting from a 
change to the structure of the incentive compensation plans in the 
first quarter of 2014.  Average commercial loans increased $3.5 billion from the prior 
year primarily due to increases in average commercial and industrial 

loans and average commercial construction loans, partially offset by 

a decrease in average commercial mortgage loans. Average 

commercial and industrial portfolio loans and average commercial 
construction portfolio loans increased $3.5 billion and $689 million, 
respectively, from the prior year as a result of an increase in new 
loan origination activity and utilization resulting from a 
strengthening economy and targeted marketing efforts. Average 

commercial mortgage portfolio loans decreased $651 million from 

the prior year due to continued run-off as the level of new 

originations was less than the repayments on the current portfolio. 
Average core deposits increased $4.1 billion from the prior 
year. The increase was the result of strong growth in average 
demand deposits, average interest checking deposits, average savings 
and money market deposits and average foreign deposits and other 
deposits which increased $1.8 billion, $973 million, $959 million and 

$338 million, respectively, from to the prior year. 

 
Comparison of 2013 with 2012 
Net income was $814 million for the year ended December 31, 
2013, compared to net income of $714 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2012. The increase in net income was primarily 
driven by increases in net interest income and noninterest income 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 45  Fifth Third Bancorp 
and a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses, partially 
offset by higher noninterest expense. 
Net interest income increased $62 million from 2012 primarily 
due to growth in average commercial and industrial loans, an 

increase in FTP credits due to increases in savings and money 

market deposits and demand deposits and a decrease in FTP 
charges on loans, partially offset by a decline in yields of 28 bps on 
average commercial loans. Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $55 million from 
2012 as a result of improved credit trends. Net charge-offs as a 

percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 41 bps for 

2013 compared to 57 bps for 2012.  
Noninterest income increased $44 million from 2012 primarily 
due to increases in other noninterest income and service charges on 
deposits, partially offset by a decrease in corporate banking revenue. 
The increase in other noninterest income of $38 million from 2012 

was primarily due to decreases in negative valuation adjustments on 

OREO, increases in operating lease income and card and processing 

revenue, and decreases in negative valuation adjustments on loans 
held for sale, partially offset by decreases in gains on loan sales. 
Service charges on deposits increased $16 million from 2012 

primarily driven by commercial deposit revenue which increased 
due to fee repricing and the acquisition of new customers. The 
decrease in corporate banking revenue of $10 million from the prior 

year was primarily driven by decreases in lease remarketing and 

letter of credit fees, partially offset by increases in syndication fees, 

foreign exchange fees and business lending fees. 
Noninterest expense increased $48 million from 2012 as a 
result of increases in other noninterest expense and salaries, 

incentives and employee benefits. Other noninterest expense 

increased $42 million from the prior year primarily driven by 

increases in impairment on affordable housing investments and 

operating lease expense, partially offset by a decrease in loan and 
lease expense. The increase in salaries, incentives and employee 
benefits of $6 million from 2012 was primarily the result of an 

increase in base compensation primarily driven by improved 

production levels. Average commercial loans increased $3.7 billion from the prior 
year primarily due to an increase in average commercial and 
industrial loans, partially offset by a decrease in average commercial 
mortgage loans. Average commercial and industrial portfolio loans 
increased $4.9 billion from December 31, 2012 as a result of an 
increase in new origination activity from an increase in demand due 

to a strengthening economy and targeted marketing efforts. Average 

commercial mortgage loans decreased $1.1 billion due to continued 

run-off as the level of new originations was less than the repayments 
of the existing portfolio. Average core deposits increased $1.5 billion from December 
31, 2012. The increase was primarily driven by strong growth in 
average savings and money market deposits and average demand 
deposits, which increased $1.6 billion and $374 million, respectively, 

from to the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in interest 

checking deposits of $700 million.

     MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  46  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Comparison of 2014 with 2013 Net income was $346 million for the year ended December 31, 

2014, compared to net income of $204 million for the year ended 

December 31, 2013. The increase was driven by an increase in net 
interest income and declines in the provision for loan and lease 
losses and noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in 
noninterest income.  
Net interest income increased $190 million from the prior year 
primarily driven by increases in the FTP credit rates for savings and 

money market deposits, demand deposits and interest checking 

deposits and a decrease in the FTP charges on loans and leases. 
These increases were partially offset by declines in yields on average 
commercial loans and a decrease in interest income relating to the 
Bancorp™s decision to no longer enroll new customers in the deposit 
advance product. Provision for loan and lease losses for 2014 decreased $29 
million from the prior year as a result of improved credit trends. 

Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases 
decreased to 110 bps for 2014 compared to 123 bps for 2013. 
Noninterest income decreased $20 million from the prior year.  
The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in other noninterest 
income and service charges on deposits, partially offset by an 

increase in card and processing revenue. Other noninterest income 

decreased $36 million from 2013 primarily due to $20 million in 

impairment charges in 2014 for branches and land. For more 

information on these impairment charges, refer to Note 7 of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The remaining 
decrease in other noninterest income was primarily due to decreases 
in gains on loan sales and mortgage origination fees and retail 
service fees. Service charges on deposits decreased $7 million from 

2013 primarily due to a decrease in consumer checking and savings 

fees from a decline in the percentage of consumer customers being 

charged service fees. Card and processing revenue increased $19 
million from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in the 
number of actively used cards as well as higher processing fees 

related to additional ATM locations.  
Noninterest expense decreased $22 million from the prior year, 
primarily driven by decreases in other noninterest expense and 

salaries, incentives and employee benefits, partially offset by 

increases in card and processing expense and net occupancy and 
equipment expense. Other noninterest expense decreased $25 
million from the prior year due to lower marketing expense and loan 
and lease expense. Salaries, incentives and employee benefits 

decreased $10 million from the prior year primarily driven by lower 
compensation costs due to a decline in the number of full-time 
equivalent employees. Card and processing expense increased $8 

million from 2013 primarily due to higher rewards expense relating 

to credit cards and increased fraud-related charges. Net occupancy 

and equipment expense increased $5 million from 2013 primarily 

due to an increase in rent expense driven by additional ATM 

locations. Average consumer loans decreased $245 million in 2014 
primarily due to a decrease in average home equity loans of $382 
million as payoffs exceeded new advances and new loan production. 

This decrease was partially offset by an increase in average credit 

card loans of $147 million from the prior year primarily due to an 
increase in open and active accounts driven by the volume of new 
accounts.  Average core deposits increased $2.4 billion from the prior 
year primarily driven by net growth in average savings and money 
market deposits of $1.8 billion and growth in average demand 
deposits of $478 million. 

 
  Comparison of 2013 with 2012 Net income was $204 million for the year ended December 31, 

2013, compared to net income of $144 million for the year ended 

December 31, 2012. The increase was driven by an increase in net 
interest income and noninterest income and a decline in the 
provision for loan and lease losses, partially offset by an increase in 

noninterest expense.  
Net interest income increased $95 million from 2012 primarily 
driven by an increase in the FTP credit rates for savings and money 

market deposits, demand deposits and interest checking deposits, a 

decrease in the FTP charges on loans and leases and a decline in 

interest expense on core deposits due to favorable shifts from 
certificates of deposit to lower cost transaction deposits. 
Provision for loan and lease losses for 2013 decreased $58 
million from 2012 as a result of improved credit trends. Net charge-

offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 
123 bps for 2013 compared to 159 bps for 2012. 
Noninterest income increased $41 million from 2012. The 
increase was primarily driven by increases in investment advisory 

revenue, card and processing revenue and service charges on 
deposits. Investment advisory revenue increased $19 million from 
2013 primarily due to increased securities and brokerage fees due to 
an increase in equity and bond market values. Card and processing 
revenue increased $12 million from the prior year due to higher 

transaction volumes, higher levels of consumer spending and the 

benefit of new products. Service charges on deposits increased $11 

million from 2012 primarily due to an increase in account 
maintenance fees due to the full year impact of new deposit product 
offerings. Noninterest expense increased $104 million from 2012, 
primarily driven by increases in salaries, incentives and employee 

benefits, card and processing expense and other noninterest 

expense. Salaries, incentives and employee benefits increased from 

2012 primarily due to an increase in bonus and incentive 

compensation associated with improved securities and brokerage 
revenue. Card and processing expense increased from 2012 due 
primarily to increases in debit and credit card transaction volumes, 
consumer spending, fraud insurance costs and credit card rewards 

expense. The increase in other noninterest expense was primarily 

due to an increase in corporate overhead allocations during 2013 

compared to 2012. 
Average consumer loans increased $297 million in 2013 
primarily due to increases in average residential mortgage portfolio 
loans of $942 million from the prior year as a result of continued 
retention of certain shorter term residential mortgage loans. In 
addition, average credit card loans increased from 2012 due to 

increases in average balances per account and the volume of new 

customers. These increases were partially offset by decreases in 

average home equity portfolio loans of $743 million from 2012 as 

payoffs exceeded new loan production. 
 Average core deposits increased $1.7 billion from the prior 
year as growth in demand deposits due to excess customer liquidity 
and a continued low interest rate environment was partially offset by the run-off of higher priced other time deposits. 
 Consumer Lending 
Consumer Lending includes the Bancorp™s mortgage, home equity, 

automobile and other indirect lending activities. Lending activities 

include the origination, retention and servicing of mortgage and 
home equity loans or lines of credit, sales and securitizations of 
those loans, pools of loans or lines of credit, and all associated 
hedging activities. Indirect lending activities include loans to 
consumers through correspondent lenders and automobile dealers.

    Comparison of 2014 with 2013 Consumer Lending incurred a net loss of $68 million in 2014 
compared to net income of $183 million in 2013. The decrease was 

driven by decreases in net interest income and noninterest income 

and an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, partially 

offset by a decrease in noninterest expense. 
Net interest income decreased $55 million from the prior year 
primarily due to decreases in average residential mortgage loans and 

average home equity loans as well as lower yields on average 
automobile loans, partially offset by a decrease in FTP charges on 
loans and leases. The provision for loan and lease losses increased $64 million 
from the prior year primarily due to an $87 million charge-off 
related to the transfer of certain residential mortgage loans from the 

portfolio to held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially 

offset by improved delinquency metrics on home equity loans. Net 

charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases increased to 77 
bps for 2014 compared to 46 bps for 2013.  
Noninterest income decreased $402 million from 2013 as a 
result of decreases in mortgage banking net revenue of $383 million 
and other noninterest income of $19 million. The decrease in 

mortgage banking net revenue was due to a $293 million decline in 

mortgage origination fees and gains on loan sales due to a decline in 

mortgage originations and a $90 million decrease in net mortgage 

servicing revenue. Refer to the Noninterest Income section of 
MD&A for additional information on the fluctuations in mortgage 
banking net revenue. The decrease in other noninterest income was 

primarily due to a $16 million decrease in securities gains.Noninterest expense decreased $133 million due to decreases 
of $93 million in salaries, incentives and benefits and $40 million in 

other noninterest expense from the prior year. The decrease in 

salaries, incentives and employee benefits was primarily the result of 

lower mortgage loan originations. The decrease in other noninterest 
expense was primarily due to decreases in loan and lease expense 
and corporate overhead allocations. Average consumer loans and leases decreased $1.3 billion from 
the prior year. Average residential mortgage loans, including held for 

sale, decreased $1.4 billion from the prior year due primarily to a 

decline of $1.5 billion in average residential mortgage loans held for 

sale from reduced origination volumes driven by a reduction in 

refinance activity and the exit of the broker origination channel 
during 2014. This decrease was partially offset by the continued 
retention of certain shorter term residential mortgage loans 
originated through the Bancorp™s retail branches and the decision to 

retain certain conforming ARMs and certain other fixed-rate loans 

originated during the year ended December 31, 2014. Average home 

equity loans decreased $77 million from the prior year as payoffs 
exceeded new loan production. Average automobile loans, including 
held for sale, increased $108 million for the current year from the 

prior year due to new originations exceeding run-off. 
  Comparison of 2013 with 2012 Net income was $183 million in 2013 compared to net income of 

$223 million in 2012. The decrease was driven by a decrease in 

noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense, partially 
offset by a decline in the provision for loan and lease losses.  
Net interest income decreased $2 million from 2012 due 
primarily to lower yields on average residential mortgage and 
automobile loans, partially offset by a decrease in FTP charges on 
loans and leases and increases in average residential mortgage and 

average automobile loans. 
The provision for loan and lease losses decreased $84 million 
from 2012 as delinquency metrics and underlying loss trends 
improved across all consumer loan types. Net charge-offs as a 
percent of average loans and leases decreased to 46 bps for 2013 

compared to 88 bps for 2012.  
Noninterest income decreased $128 million from 2012 
primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking net revenue of $143 

million, partially offset by an increase in other noninterest income of 

$15 million. The decrease in mortgage banking net revenue was 

primarily due to a decrease in gains on loan sales of $368 million as 

a result of a decrease in profit margins on sold residential mortgage 

loans coupled with a decrease in residential mortgage loan 

originations, partially offset by a $223 million increase in net 
residential mortgage servicing revenue. The increase in net 
residential mortgage servicing revenue was driven by an increase of 

$202 million in net valuation adjustments on MSRs and free-

standing derivatives entered into to economically hedge the MSRs 
and a decrease of $20 million in servicing rights amortization. The 
increase in other noninterest income was primarily due to a $12 

million increase in securities gains and a $7 million decline in losses 

on the sale of OREO. 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  48  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Noninterest expense increased $15 million driven by an 
increase of $31 million in other noninterest expense, partially offset 

by a decrease of $16 million in salaries, incentives and employee 

benefits compared to 2012. The increase in other noninterest 
expense was primarily due to higher litigation expense and an 
increase in corporate overhead allocations, partially offset by a 
decrease in loan and lease expense due to lower appraisal costs. The 

decrease in salaries, incentives and employee benefits was due to a 

decline in incentive compensation driven primarily by a decline in 

originations during 2013 compared to 2012, partially offset by an 

increase in deferred compensation for 2013 compared to 2012. 
Average consumer loans and leases increased $200 million 
from 2012. Average residential mortgage loans, including held for 
sale, increased $79 million for 2013 compared to 2012 due to strong 
refinancing activity that occurred in the first half of 2013. Average 

automobile loans increased $218 million in 2013 compared to 2012 

due to an increase in originations primarily driven by modest 

improvement in general economic conditions and a continued low 
interest rate environment. Average home equity portfolio loans 
decreased $83 million for 2013 compared to 2012 as payoffs 
exceeded new loan production. Average other consumer loans and 
leases decreased $14 million in 2013 resulting from a decrease in 
average consumer leases due to run-off as the Bancorp discontinued 

automobile leasing in 2008, partially offset by an increase in average 

other consumer loans.

    Comparison of 2014 with 2013 Net income was $54 million in 2014 compared to net income of $68 
million for 2013. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a 
decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in 

noninterest expense and an increase in noninterest income.  
Net interest income decreased $33 million from 2013 primarily 
due to a decrease in the FTP credit rate on certain interest checking 

deposits. Noninterest income increased $4 million from the prior year 
due to a $13 million increase in investment advisory revenue 
primarily driven by an increase of $12 million in private client 
services revenue due to growth in personal asset management fees, 

partially offset by a decrease in securities broker fees due to a 
decline in transactional brokerage revenue. This increase was 
partially offset by a $9 million decrease in other noninterest income 

as other noninterest income in the prior year included gains on the 

sale of certain advisory contracts.
 Noninterest expense decreased $8 million from the prior year 
primarily due to a decrease in other noninterest expense driven by 
decreases in operational losses, marketing expense and corporate 

overhead allocations.
 Average loans and leases increased $256 million from the prior 
year primarily driven by increases in average residential mortgage 
loans and average commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by a 
decrease in average home equity loans.
 Average core deposits 
increased $720 million from the prior year due to growth in average 

interest checking balances as customers have opted to maintain 
excess funds in liquid transaction accounts as a result of interest 
rates remaining near historic lows.
  
Comparison of 2013 with 2012 Net income was $68 million in 2013 compared to net income of $43 
million for 2012. The increase in net income was primarily due to 

increases in net interest income and noninterest income and a 

decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses, partially offset by 

an increase in noninterest expense.  
Net interest income increased $37 million from 2012 due to an 
increase in FTP credits resulting from an increase in interest 

checking deposits. 
Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $8 million from 
the prior year. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and 

leases decreased to 9 bps compared to 53 bps for the prior year 

reflecting improved credit trends during 2013.  
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 49  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Noninterest income increased $10 million compared to 2012 
due to an increase in investment advisory revenue, partially offset a 

decrease in other noninterest income. The increase in investment 

advisory revenue was primarily driven by increases in securities and 

brokerage fees and private client service fees due to strong 

production and an increase in equity and bond market values. The 
decrease in other noninterest income was due to a decrease in gains 
on sales of held for sale loans and the impact of the gain on the sale 

of certain FTAM funds in the third quarter of 2012. 
Noninterest expense increased $16 million compared to 2012 
due to an increase in other noninterest expense primarily driven by 

increases in corporate allocations and fraud losses. Average loans and leases increased $137 million compared to 
2012 primarily driven by increases in average residential mortgage, 
average other consumer and average commercial and industrial 
loans, partially offset by a decrease in average commercial mortgage 

loans. Average core deposits increased $1.1 billion compared to 

2012 due to growth in interest checking as customers have opted to 

maintain excess funds in liquid transaction accounts as a result of 
the low interest rate environment. 
  General Corporate and Other 
General Corporate and Other includes the unallocated portion of 
the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, 

certain non-core deposit funding, unassigned equity, provision 
expense in excess of net charge-offs or a benefit from the reduction 
of the ALLL, representation and warranty expense in excess of 
actual losses or a benefit from the reduction of representation and 
warranty reserves, the payment of preferred stock dividends and 

certain support activities and other items not attributed to the 

business segments. 

 
Comparison of 2014 with 2013 Results for 2014 and 2013 were impacted by a benefit of $260 
million and $269 million, respectively, due to reductions in the 
ALLL. Net interest income decreased from $147 million in 2013 to 
$3 million for 2014 primarily due to increases in FTP credits and 

interest expense on long-term debt and a decrease in the benefit 

related to the FTP charges on loans and leases, partially offset by an 

increase in interest income on taxable securities. Noninterest 
income was $256 million for 2014 compared to $659 million in 
2013. Noninterest income included the impact of a gain of $125 

million on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the second quarter of 
2014 compared to gains totaling $327 million during the second and 
third quarters of 2013. The Bancorp also recognized gains of $23 

million and $9 million associated with a tax receivable agreement 

with Vantiv, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, 

respectively. The positive valuation adjustments on the stock 
warrant associated with Vantiv Holding, LLC were $31 million and 
$206 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, 

respectively. Additionally, the equity method earnings from the 
Bancorp™s interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC decreased $29 million 
from 2013. Noninterest income also included $38 million in 

negative valuation adjustments related to the Visa total return swap 

for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $31 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2013. 
Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 
was a benefit of $12 million compared to an expense of $159 

million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was 
driven by decreases in compensation expense, FDIC insurance and 
other taxes and litigation and regulatory activity, partially offset by a 

decrease in the benefit from other noninterest expense driven by 

decreased corporate overhead allocations from General Corporate 
and Other to the other business segments. 
Comparison of 2013 with 2012 Results for 2013 and 2012 were impacted by a benefit of $269 

million and $400 million, respectively, due to reductions in the 

ALLL. The decrease in provision expense was primarily due to a 

decrease in nonperforming loans and leases and improvements in 

delinquency metrics and underlying loss trends. Net interest income 
decreased from $370 million in 2012 to $147 million for 2013 
primarily due to a decrease in FTP charges partially offset by a 
decrease in interest expense on long-term debt. Noninterest income 

increased $278 million compared to 2012 primarily due to positive 

valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv 

Holding, LLC which increased $139 million in 2013 compared to 

2012. In addition, gains of $242 million and $85 million were 

recognized on the sales of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the second and 
third quarters of 2013, respectively, compared to gains of $115 
million related to the Vantiv, Inc. IPO and $157 million on the sale 

of Vantiv, Inc. shares in 2012. The Bancorp also recognized a gain 

of $9 million associated with a tax receivable agreement with Vantiv, 

Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2013. The equity method earnings from 

the Bancorp™s interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC increased $16 million 

from 2012. Noninterest expense decreased $286 million compared to 2012 
due to decreases in other noninterest expense and total personnel 
costs. Other noninterest expense decreased due to a decrease in 

debt extinguishment costs, an increase in corporate overhead 

allocations assigned to the segments, a decrease in loan and lease 

expense and a decrease in losses and adjustments. Debt 
extinguishment costs decreased $161 million during 2013 compared 
to 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Bancorp incurred $8 

million of debt extinguishment costs associated with the redemption 
of outstanding TruPS issued by Fifth Third Capital Trust IV. 
During 2012, the Bancorp incurred $160 million of debt 

extinguishment costs associated with the redemption of certain 

TruPS and the termination of certain FHLB debt. Loan and lease 

expense decreased $72 million during 2013 compared to 2012 
primarily due to a decrease in loan closing fees due to a decline in 
mortgage originations. Losses and adjustments decreased $17 

million compared to 2012 primarily driven by a decline in the 
provision for representation and warranty claims partially offset by 
an increase in litigation expense. The provision for representation 

and warranty claims changed from a $49 million expense for the 

year ended December 31, 2012 to a benefit of $39 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2013 due to the Bancorp recording 
significant additions to the reserve in 2012 as the result of additional 

information obtained from FHLMC regarding their file selection 

criteria which enabled the Bancorp to better estimate the losses that 
were probable on loans sold to FHLMC with representation and 
warranty provisions. In addition, 2013 included a decrease in the 

representation and warranty reserve due to improving underlying 

repurchase metrics and the settlement with FHLMC. The decrease 
in representation and warranty expense was partially offset by a $54 

million increase in litigation expense. Total personnel costs 
decreased $38 million from 2012 due primarily to decreases in 

incentive compensation and employee benefits. 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  50  Fifth Third Bancorp 
FOURTH QUARTER REVIEW The Bancorp™s 2014 fourth quarter net income available to common 
shareholders was $362 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared 
to net income available to common shareholders of $328 million, or 
$0.39 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2014 and net income 

available to common shareholders of $383 million, or $0.43 per 
diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 
earnings included a $56 million positive adjustment on the valuation 

of the warrant associated with the sale of Vantiv Holding, LLC, a 

$23 million gain from Vantiv Inc. pursuant to a tax receivable 

agreement and a $19 million charge related to the valuation of the 
total return swap entered into as part of the 2009 sale of Visa, Inc. 
Class B shares. Third quarter 2014 results included a $53 million 
negative adjustment on the valuation of the warrant associated with 
the sale of Vantiv Holding, LLC. Fourth quarter 2013 earnings 

included a $91 million positive adjustment on the valuation of the 

warrant associated with the sale of Vantiv Holding, LLC, $69 

million in net charges to increase litigation reserves, an $18 million 

charge related to the valuation of the total return swap entered into 
as part of the 2009 sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares and $8 million of 
debt extinguishment costs associated with the redemption of TruPS 

issued by Fifth Third Capital Trust IV.  
Fourth quarter 2014 net interest income of $888 million 
decreased $20 million from the third quarter of 2014 and $17 

million from the same period a year ago. Interest income decreased 

$7 million from the third quarter of 2014 primarily driven by the 

effects of loan repricing and lower average investment securities 
balances. Interest expense increased $13 million from the third 
quarter of 2014 primarily driven by the issuance of $850 million of 
long-term debt during the third quarter and higher deposit costs 

during the quarter. The decrease in net interest income in 

comparison to the fourth quarter of 2013 was driven by the effects 

of loan repricing and higher interest expense from increased long-

term debt balances, partially offset by higher average investment 
securities balances and average loan balances.  
Fourth quarter 2014 noninterest income of $653 million 
increased $133 million compared to the third quarter of 2014 and 

decreased $50 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The 

increase from the third quarter of 2014 was primarily due to 

increases in other noninterest income and corporate banking 

revenue. The year-over-year decline was primarily the result of lower 
mortgage banking net revenue and other noninterest income, 
partially offset by higher corporate banking revenue. Service charges on deposits of $142 million decreased $3 
million from the previous quarter and were flat compared to the 

fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease from the third quarter of 2014 

was primarily due to a decrease in commercial service charges due to 

a decrease in treasury management fees and a decrease in retail 

service charges due to lower overdraft occurrences.  
Corporate banking revenue of $120 million increased $20 
million from the previous quarter and $26 million from the fourth 
quarter of 2013. The increase from the third quarter of 2014 was 
primarily due to a $13 million increase in syndication fees during the 

fourth quarter of 2014 due to the investment in resources in the 

commercial business.  In addition, the increase from the third 

quarter of 2014 was due to an increase in business lending fees and 

an increase in foreign exchange fees, partially offset by a decrease in 
institutional sales revenue. The year-over-year increase was driven 
by higher syndication fees and lease remarketing fees. The increase 
in syndication fees from the fourth quarter of 2013 was due to the 
investment in resources in the commercial business and a 

strengthening economy. The increase in lease remarketing fees year-

over-year was impacted by a $9 million write-down of equipment 

value on an operating lease during the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Investment advisory revenue of $100 million decreased $3 
million from the previous quarter and increased $2 million from the 
fourth quarter of 2013. The decline from the third quarter of 2014 
was due to a decrease in private client service fees and insurance 

fees relative to elevated levels in the third quarter, as well as a 

decrease in securities and brokerage fees due to a continued shift 

from transaction-based fees to recurring revenue streams. The year-

over-year increase was due to an increase in personal asset 

management fees due to market-related growth, partially offset by a 

decrease in securities and brokerage fees.  
Mortgage banking net revenue was $61 million in both the 
fourth and third quarters of 2014 and $126 million in the fourth 

quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 originations were $1.7 billion, 

compared with $2.1 billion in the previous quarter and $2.6 billion 

in the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter 2014 originations 

resulted in gains of $36 million on mortgages sold, compared with 

gains of $34 million during the previous quarter and $60 million 

during the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase from the prior 
quarter was driven by higher gain on sale margins, partially offset by 
lower production. The decrease from the prior year was due to 

lower production, including Fifth Third™s exit from the broker 
channel, partially offset by higher gain on sale margins. Mortgage 
servicing fees were $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, $61 

million in the third quarter of 2014 and $63 million in the fourth 

quarter of 2013. Mortgage banking net revenue is also affected by 

net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include MSR 
amortization and MSR valuation adjustments, including mark-to-
market adjustments on free-standing derivatives used to 

economically hedge the MSR portfolio. These net servicing asset 
valuation adjustments were negative $34 million in both the fourth 
and third quarters of 2014 and positive $3 million in the fourth 

quarter of 2013.  Card and processing revenue of $76 million increased $1 
million compared to the third quarter of 2014 and $5 million from 
the fourth quarter of 2013. The increases from both periods were 
driven by higher transaction volumes and an increase in the number 
of actively used cards. Other noninterest income of $150 million increased $117 
million compared to the third quarter of 2014 and decreased $20 

million from the fourth quarter of 2013.  Fourth quarter 2014 

results included a $56 million positive valuation adjustment on the 

Vantiv Holding, LLC warrant and $23 million in gains pursuant to 
Fifth Third™s tax receivable agreement with Vantiv Holding, LLC. 
This compares with a $53 million negative warrant valuation 
adjustment in the third quarter of 2014, and a $91 million positive 

warrant valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2013 as well as 

$9 million in gains pursuant to Fifth Third™s tax receivable 

agreement with Vantiv Holding, LLC, recognized in the fourth 

quarter of 2013. Quarterly results also included charges related to 
the valuation of the total return swap entered into as part of the 
2009 sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. Negative valuation 
adjustments on this swap were $19 million, $3 million and $18 
million in the fourth quarter of 2014, the third quarter of 2014 and 

the fourth quarter of 2013, respectively. 
The net gains on investment securities were $4 million in the 
fourth quarter of 2014, $3 million in the third quarter of 2014 and 

$2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.  Noninterest expense of $918 million increased $30 million 
from the previous quarter and decreased $71 million from the 
fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in noninterest expense 
compared to the third quarter of 2014 was driven by an increase in 

personnel costs, an increase in provision expense from the reserve 

for unfunded commitments and an increase in operational losses in 

the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease in noninterest expense 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 51  Fifth Third Bancorp 
from the fourth quarter of 2013 was primarily due to $69 million in 
charges to litigation reserves in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared 

to a $3 million reversal of litigation reserves in the fourth quarter of 

2014, partially offset by an increase in credit-related costs in the 

fourth quarter of 2014.  The ALLL as a percentage of portfolio loans and leases was 
1.47% as of December 31, 2014, compared to 1.56% as of 
September 30, 2014 and 1.79% as of December 31, 2013. Net 
charge-offs were $191 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, or 83 
bps of average loans on an annualized basis, compared with net 

charge-offs of $115 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $148 

million in the fourth quarter of 2013. During the fourth quarter of 

2014, the Bancorp transferred certain residential mortgage loans 

from the portfolio to held for sale resulting in a charge-off of $87 
million.   TABLE 21: QUARTERLY INFORMATION (unaudited)

$5. b COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED 2013 WITH 2012 
The Bancorp™s net income available to common shareholders for 

the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1.8 billion, or $2.02 per 
diluted share, which was net of $37 million in preferred stock 

dividends. The Bancorp™s net income available to common 
shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $1.5 billion, 
or $1.66 per diluted share, which was net of $35 million in preferred 

stock dividends. Overall, credit trends improved in 2013, and as a 

result, the provision for loan and lease losses decreased to $229 

million in 2013 compared to $303 million in 2012.  
Net interest income was $3.6 billion for both the years ended 
December 31, 2013 and 2012. Net interest income was negatively 
impacted by a decline of 36 bps in yields on the Bancorp™s interest-
earning assets, partially offset by a $4.3 billion increase in average 
loans and leases due primarily to increases in average commercial 

and industrial loans and average residential mortgage loans. In 

addition, interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in 

rates paid on average long-term debt and a reduction in higher cost 
average long-term debt.  
Noninterest income increased $228 million, or eight percent, in 
2013 compared to 2012. The increase from 2012 was primarily due 
to increases in other noninterest income partially offset by decreases 
in mortgage banking net revenue. Other noninterest income 

increased $305 million compared to 2012, primarily due to positive 

valuation adjustments on the stock warrant associated with Vantiv 

Holding, LLC. In addition, the Bancorp recognized gains of $242 
million and $85 million, on the sale of Vantiv, Inc. shares in the 
second and third quarters of 2013, respectively, compared to gains 

of $115 million related to the Vantiv, Inc. IPO recorded in the first 
quarter of 2012 and a $157 million gain on the sale of Vantiv shares 
during the fourth quarter of 2012. Mortgage banking net revenue 

decreased $145 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 

compared to 2012 primarily due to a decrease in origination fees and 
gains on loan sales partially offset by an increase in positive net 
valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights and free-

standing derivatives entered into to economically hedge the MSR 

portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $120 million, or three percent, 
in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a decrease in other 

noninterest expense driven by a decrease in debt extinguishment 
costs and a decrease in the provision for representation and 
warranty claims partially offset by an increase in litigation expense. 
Net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and 
leases decreased to 0.58% during 2013 compared to 0.85% during 
2012 largely due to improved credit trends across all commercial 
and consumer loan types. 
The Bancorp took a number of actions that impacted its capital 
position in 2013. In March of 2013, the Bancorp announced the 

results of its capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of the 2013 

CCAR. The FRB indicated to the Bancorp that it did not object to 

the following proposed capital actions for the period beginning 
April 1, 2013 and ending March 31, 2014: the potential increase in 
its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.12 per share; the 
potential repurchase of up to $750 million in TruPS, subject to the 
determination of a regulatory capital event and replacement with the 

issuance of a similar amount of Tier II-qualifying subordinated debt; 

the potential conversion of the $398 million in outstanding Series G 

8.5% convertible preferred stock into approximately 35.5 million 

common shares issued to the holders and the repurchase of an 
equivalent amount of common shares issued in the conversion up 
to $550 million in market value, and the issuance of $550 million in 
preferred shares; the potential repurchase of common shares in an 
amount up to $984 million, including any shares issued in a Series G 

preferred stock conversion; incremental repurchase of common 

shares in the amount of any after-tax gains from the sale of Vantiv, 

Inc stock and the potential issuance of an additional $500 million in 

preferred stock. Actions consistent with these proposed capital 
actions were substantially completed in 2013. The FRB launched the 2014 stress testing program and CCAR 
on November 1, 2013. The stress testing results and capital plan 
were submitted by the Bancorp to the FRB on January 6, 2014. 
Additionally, the Bancorp entered into a number of accelerated 
share repurchase transactions in 2013.  Refer to Note 23 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information 

on the accelerated share repurchase transactions.

  Loans and leases, including loans held for sale, increased $1.8 
billion, or two percent, from December 31, 2013. The increase in 

loans and leases from December 31, 2013 was the result of a $1.9 
billion, or four percent, increase in commercial loans and leases 
partially offset by a $133 million decrease in consumer loans and 

leases.  Commercial loans and leases increased from December 31, 
2013 primarily due to increases in commercial and industrial loans 

and commercial construction loans partially offset by a decrease in 

commercial mortgage loans. Commercial and industrial loans 

increased $1.5 billion, or four percent, from December 31, 2013 and 
commercial construction loans increased $1.0 billion, or 99%, from 
December 31, 2013 primarily driven by an increase in new loan 
origination activity and utilization resulting from a strengthening 
economy and targeted marketing efforts. Commercial mortgage 

loans decreased $659 million, or eight percent, from December 31, 

2013 due to continued run-off as the level of new originations was 
outpaced by increased repayments on the current portfolio.  
Consumer loans and leases decreased from December 31, 2013 
primarily due to a decrease in home equity partially offset by an 
increase in credit card loans. Home equity decreased $360 million, 

or four percent, from December 31, 2013 as payoffs exceeded new 

loan production. Credit card loans increased $107 million, or five 

percent, from December 31, 2013 primarily due to an increase in 
average balances per account and an increase in new customer 
accounts.   TABLE 23: COMPONENTS OF AVERAGE TOTAL LOANS AND LEASES (INCLUDES HELD FOR SALE)

from December 31, 2013 was the result of a $3.4 billion, or seven 

percent, increase in average commercial loans and leases partially 

offset by a $1.4 billion, or four percent, decrease in average 
consumer loans and leases. 
Average commercial loans and leases increased from 
December 31, 2013 primarily due to increases in average 
commercial and industrial loans and average commercial 

construction loans partially offset by a decrease in average 

commercial mortgage loans. Average commercial and industrial 

loans increased $3.4 billion, or nine percent, from December 31, 
2013 and average commercial construction loans increased $699 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

million, or 88%, from December 31, 2013 primarily due to an 
increase in new loan origination activity and utilization resulting 

from a strengthening economy and targeted marketing efforts. 

Average commercial mortgage loans decreased $736 million, or nine 

percent, from December 31, 2013 due to continued run-off as the 

level of new originations was outpaced by increased repayments on 
the current portfolio. 
Average consumer loans and leases decreased from December 
31, 2013 primarily due to decreases in average residential mortgage 

loans and average home equity partially offset by an increase in 

average credit card loans. Average residential mortgage loans 

decreased $1.1 billion, or eight percent, from December 31, 2013 

primarily due to a decline in average loans held for sale of $1.5 
billion from reduced origination volumes driven by a reduction in 
refinance activity and the exit of the broker origination channel 

during 2014. This decrease was partially offset by the continued 

retention of certain shorter term residential mortgage loans 

originated through the Bancorp™s retail branches and the decision to 

retain certain conforming ARMs and certain other fixed-rate loans 
originated during the year ended December 31, 2014. Average home 
equity decreased $495 million, or five percent, from December 31, 

2013 as payoffs exceeded new loan production. Average credit card 

loans increased $150 million, or seven percent, from December 31, 

2013 primarily due to an increase in open and active accounts driven 

by the volume of new customer accounts.    
Investment Securities 
The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing 
interest rate risk, providing liquidity support and providing collateral 
for pledging purposes. As of December 31, 2014, total investment 

securities were $23.0 billion compared to $19.1 billion at December 

31, 2013. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for the Bancorp™s methodology for both classifying 
investment securities and management™s evaluation of securities in 

an unrealized loss position for OTTI.  
At December 31, 2014, the Bancorp™s investment portfolio 
consisted primarily of AAA-rated available-for-sale securities. The 
Bancorp did not hold asset-backed securities backed by subprime 

mortgage loans in its investment portfolio. Additionally, securities 
classified as below investment grade were immaterial as of 
December 31, 2014 and 2013. The Bancorp™s management has 
evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position in the 

available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios for OTTI. The 

Bancorp recognized $24 million, $74 million and $58 million of 

OTTI on its available-for-sale and other debt securities, included in 

securities gains, net and securities gains, net Œ non-qualifying hedges 

on mortgage servicing rights, in the Bancorp™s Consolidated 

Statements of Income during the years ended December 31, 2014, 
2013 and 2012, respectively. The Bancorp did not recognize OTTI 
on any of its available-for-sale equity securities or held-to-maturity 
debt securities for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 
2012.  TABLE 24: COMPONENTS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES

 (a)Equity securities consist of FHLB and FRB restricted stock holdings that are carried at par, FHLMC and FNMA preferred stock 
holdings and certain mutual fund holdings and equity security 
holdings. 
As of December 31, 2014, available-for-sale and other securities on 
an amortized cost basis increased $3.3 billion, or 18%, from 
December 31, 2013 primarily due to an increase in agency 

commercial mortgage-backed securities partially offset by a decrease 

in asset-backed securities and other debt securities. Agency 

commercial mortgage-backed securities increased $4.5 billion from 
December 31, 2013 due to $4.7 billion in purchases of agency 
commercial mortgage-backed securities partially offset by $196 
million in sales and $20 million in paydowns on the portfolio during 
the year ended December 31, 2014. Asset-backed securities and 

other debt securities decreased $822 million, or 38%, due primarily 

to sales of $1.1 billion of asset-backed securities, collateralized loan 

obligations and corporate bonds and paydowns on the portfolio of

  54  Fifth Third Bancorp 
$45 million partially offset by the purchase of $297 million of asset-
backed securities during the year ended December 31, 2014.  
On an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale and other 
securities were 18% and 16% of total interest-earning assets at 
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The estimated weighted-
average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale and other 
portfolio was 5.8 years at December 31, 2014, compared to 6.7 years 

at December 31, 2013. In addition, at December 31, 2014, the 

available-for-sale and other securities portfolio had a weighted-

average yield of 3.31%, compared to 3.39% at December 31, 2013. 
Information presented in Table 25 is on a weighted-average life 
basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is 
presented on a FTE basis and is computed using historical cost 
balances. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-

sale portfolio exclude equity securities that have no stated yield or 

maturity. Total net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale and 
other securities portfolio were $731 million at December 31, 2014, 
compared to $188 million at December 31, 2013. The increase from 
December 31, 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates 
during the year ended December 31, 2014. The fair value of 

investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, 

market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of 

investment securities generally increases when interest rates decrease 
or when credit spreads contract.

       Core deposits increased $6.1 billion, or seven percent, compared to 
December 31, 2013, driven by an increase of $5.7 billion, or six 
percent, in transaction deposits and an increase of $430 million, or 
12%, in other time deposits. Total transaction deposits increased 

from December 31, 2013 due to increases in money market 
deposits, demand deposits and interest checking deposits partially 
offset by decreases in savings deposits and foreign office deposits. 

Money market deposits increased $5.4 billion, or 47%, from 

December 31, 2013 primarily driven by balance migration from 

savings deposits which decreased $2.0 billion, or 12%. The 
remaining increase in money market deposits was due to a 
promotional product offering and the acquisition of new customers. 
Demand deposits increased $2.2 billion, or seven percent, from 
December 31, 2013 primarily due to an increase in commercial 

customer balances and new commercial customer accounts. Interest 
checking deposits increased $925 million, or four percent, from 
December 31, 2013 primarily due to an increase in commercial 
customer balances and new commercial customer accounts. Foreign 
office deposits decreased $862 million, or 44%, from December 31, 

2013 primarily due to lower balances per account. Other time 
deposits increased $430 million, or 12%, from December 31, 2013 
primarily from the acquisition of new customers due to promotional 

interest rates. The Bancorp uses certificates $100,000 and over as a method 
to fund earning assets. At December 31, 2014, certificates $100,000 
and over decreased $3.7 billion, or 56%, compared to December 31, 
2013 primarily due to the maturity and run-off of retail and

  On an average basis, core deposits increased $6.8 billion, or eight 
percent, compared to December 31, 2013 primarily due to an 
increase of $6.8 billion, or eight percent, in average transaction 
deposits. The increase in average transaction deposits was driven by 

an increase in average money market deposits, average demand 

deposits and average interest checking deposits, partially offset by a 
decrease in average savings deposits. Average money market 
deposits increased $5.2 billion, or 55%, from December 31, 2013 

primarily driven by balance migration from savings deposits which 

decreased $2.4 billion, or 13%. The remaining increase in average 
money market deposits was due to a promotional product offering, 
an increase in average commercial account balances and new 
customer accounts. Average demand deposits increased $1.8 billion, 
or six percent, from December 31, 2013 primarily due to an increase 
in average commercial account balances and new commercial 

customer accounts. Average interest checking deposits increased 

$1.8 billion, or eight percent from December 31, 2013 primarily due 

to an increase in average balance per account and new commercial 
customer accounts. Average certificates $100,000 and over 
decreased $2.4 billion, or 38%, from December 31, 2013 due 

primarily to the maturity and run-off of retail and institutional

reserve accounts held at Federal Reserve Banks that the Bancorp 
purchased from other member banks on an overnight basis. Other 

short-term borrowings increased $176 million, or 13%, from 
December 31, 2013 driven by an increase in cash held as collateral 
related to derivative agreements with various counterparties. 

Additionally, the utilization of short-term funding remained low in 

2014 due to strong deposit growth and to comply with regulatory 

standards which require greater dependency on long-term and stable 
funding. Long-term debt increased $5.3 billion, or 55%, from 
December 31, 2013 primarily driven by the issuance of $2.9 billion 
of unsecured senior bank notes and the issuance of asset-backed 
securities by consolidated VIEs of $3.8 billion related to automobile 

loan securitizations during 2014, partially offset by $1.4 billion of 
paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan 
securitizations. For additional information regarding automobile 

securitizations and long-term debt, refer to Note 10 and 16, 

respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

partially offset by decreases in average federal funds purchased and 

average other short-term borrowings. The increase in average long-
term debt of $5.0 billion, or 63%, was driven primarily by the 
issuances of long-term debt as discussed above. The level of average 

federal funds purchased and average other short-term borrowings 
can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on 
funding needs and which sources are used to satisfy those needs. 

Additionally, the utilization of short-term funding remained low in 

2014 due to strong deposit growth and to comply with regulatory 
standards which require greater dependency on long-term and stable 
funding.  Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is 
discussed in the net interest income section of MD&A. In addition,

of the Bancorp™s risk management approach within the structure of 

the Bancorp™s affiliate operating model. In addition, the Internal 
Audit division provides an independent assessment of the Bancorp™s 

internal control structure and related systems and processes. 
The assumption of risk requires robust and active risk 
management practices that comprise an integrated and 
comprehensive set of activities, measures and strategies that apply to 
the entire organization. The Bancorp has established a Risk Appetite 
Framework, approved by the Board, that provides the foundations 
of corporate risk capacity, risk appetite and risk tolerances. The 

Bancorp™s risk capacity is represented by its available financial 

resources. Risk capacity sets an absolute limit on risk-assumption in 

the Bancorp™s annual and strategic plans. The Bancorp understands 
that not all financial resources may persist as viable loss buffers over 
time. Further, consideration must be given to regulatory capital 
buffers required per Capital Policy Targets that would reduce risk 
capacity. Those factors take the form of capacity adjustments to 

arrive at an Operating Risk Capacity which represents the operating 

risk level the Bancorp can assume while maintaining its solvency 

standard. The Bancorp™s policy currently discounts its Operating 

Risk Capacity by a minimum of five percent to provide a buffer; as a 
result, the Bancorp™s risk appetite is limited by policy to, at most, 
95% of its Operating Risk Capacity. 
Economic capital is the amount of unencumbered financial 
resources required to support the Bancorp™s risks. The Bancorp 

measures economic capital under the assumption that it expects to 

maintain debt ratings at strong investment grade levels over time. 

The Bancorp™s capital policies require that the Operating Risk 
Capacity less the aforementioned buffer exceed the calculated 
economic capital required in its business. Risk appetite is the aggregate amount of risk the Bancorp is 
willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic and financial objectives. 
By establishing boundaries around risk taking and business 

decisions, and by incorporating the needs and goals of its 

shareholders, regulators, rating agencies and customers, the 
Bancorp™s risk appetite is aligned with its priorities and goals. Risk 
tolerance is the maximum amount of risk applicable to each of the 

eight specific risk categories included in its Enterprise Risk 

Management Framework. This is expressed primarily in qualitative 
terms. The Bancorp™s risk appetite and risk tolerances are supported 
by risk targets and risk limits. Those limits are used to monitor the 

amount of risk assumed at a granular level. On a quarterly basis, the 

Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board reviews performance 
against key risk limits as well as current assessments of each of the 
eight risk types relative to the established tolerance. Any results over 

limits or outside of tolerance require the development of an action 

plan that describes actions to be taken to return the measure to 
within the limit or tolerance. The risks faced by the Bancorp include, but are not limited to, 
credit, market, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance, legal, 

reputational and strategic. Each of these risks is managed through 
the Bancorp™s risk program which includes the following key 

functions: 
   Ł   Enterprise Risk Management is responsible for developin
gand overseeing the implementation of risk programs and
reporting that facilitate a broad integrated view of risk. The

department also leads the continual fostering of a strong ris
kmanagement culture and the framework, policies and

committees that support effective risk governance, includin
g the oversight of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance; 
 Ł Commercial Credit Risk Management is responsible fo
r overseeing the safety and soundness of the commercial loan
portfolio within an independent portfolio managemen

 Ł Risk Strategies and Reporting is responsible for quantitative 
analysis needed to support the commercial dual ratin
g methodology, ALLL methodology and analytics needed to 
assess credit risk and develop mitigation strategies related to 
that risk. The department also provides oversight, reportin
g and monitoring of commercial underwriting and credit 

administration processes. The Risk Strategies and Reportin

groups and utilizing a value at risk model for Bancorp 
market risk exposure;  Ł Regulatory Compliance Risk Management ensures tha
t processes are in place to monitor and comply with federal 

and state banking regulations, including processes related to 

fiduciary, CRA and fair lending compliance. The function 

also has the responsibility for maintenance of an enterprise-
wide compliance framework; and 
 Ł The ERM division creates and maintains other functions, 
committees or processes as are necessary to effectivel
y oversee risk management throughout the Bancorp. 
 
Risk management oversight and governance is provided by the 
Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and 
through multiple management committees whose membership 

includes a broad cross-section of line-of-business, affiliate and 
support representatives. The Risk and Compliance Committee of 
the Board of Directors consists of five outside directors and has the 

responsibility for the oversight of risk management for the Bancorp, 

as well as for the Bancorp™s overall aggregate risk profile. The Risk 
and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors has approved 
the formation of key management governance committees that are 

responsible for evaluating risks and controls. The primary 

committee responsible for the oversight of risk management is the 
ERMC. Committees accountable to the ERMC, which support the 
core risk programs, are the Corporate Credit Committee, the 

Operational Risk Committee, the Management Compliance 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  58  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Committee, the Asset/Liability Committee and the Enterprise 
Marketing Committee. Other committees accountable to the ERMC 

oversee the ALLL, capital and CRA/fair lending functions. In 

addition, the Legal and Regulatory Reserve Committee, which is 
accountable to the Operational Risk Committee, reviews and 
monitors significant legal and regulatory matters to ensure that 
reserves for potential litigation losses are established when such 

losses are both probable and subject to reasonable estimation. There 

are also new products and initiatives processes applicable to every 

line of business to ensure an appropriate standard readiness 

assessment is performed before launching a new product or 

initiative. Significant risk policies approved by the management 
governance committees are also reviewed and approved by the Risk 
and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. 
Credit Risk Review is an independent function responsible for 
evaluating the sufficiency of underwriting, documentation and 

approval processes for consumer and commercial credits, the 

accuracy of risk grades assigned to commercial credit exposure, 
nonaccrual status, specific reserves and monitoring for charge-offs. 
Credit Risk Review reports directly to the Risk and Compliance 
Committee of the Board of Directors and administratively to the 
Chief Auditor. The Bancorp conducts regular reviews of the business it serves 
based on the changing competitive and regulatory environment. 

Based on the most recent review, the Bancorp exited the Residential 
Wholesale Loan Broker business during the first quarter of 2014.  
CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 
The objective of the Bancorp™s credit risk management strategy is to 

quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as 
well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a 
borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual 

obligations to the Bancorp. The Bancorp's credit risk management 
strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, 
diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective 

credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices. 

These practices include conservative exposure and counterparty 

limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collection 
standards. The Bancorp's credit risk management strategy also 
emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer 

level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely 
management reviews of large credit exposures and credits 
experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Credit officers with the 

authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, 

the utilization of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities 
are centrally managed, and ERM manages the policy and the 
authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review 

function provides objective assessments of the quality of 
underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and 
the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The 

Bancorp™s credit review process and overall assessment of the 
adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly 
assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan 

and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to 

promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the 

portfolio, maintain an adequate reserve and take any necessary 
charge-offs.  The Bancorp defines potential problem loans and 
leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of 

a nonperforming asset or a restructured loan.  Refer to Note 6 of 
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further 
information on the Bancorp™s credit grade categories, which are 

derived from standard regulatory rating definitions.   
 The following tables provide a summary of potential problem loans and leases as of December 31:

In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that 
exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial 

credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. 

The risk grading system currently utilized for reserve analysis 

purposes encompasses ten categories. The Bancorp also maintains a 

dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio 
monitoring and capital allocation that includes a ﬁthrough-the-cycleﬂ 
rating philosophy for modeling expected losses. The dual risk rating 

system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and 

an additional six grade categories for estimating losses given an 

event of default. The probability of default and loss given default 

evaluations are not separated in the ten-category risk rating system. 

The Bancorp has completed significant validation and testing of the 

dual risk rating system as a commercial credit risk management tool. 
The Bancorp is assessing the necessary modifications to the dual 
risk rating system outputs to develop a U.S. GAAP compliant 

ALLL model and will make a decision on the use of modified dual 

risk ratings for purposes of determining the Bancorp™s ALLL once 

the FASB has issued a final standard regarding proposed 
methodology changes to the determination of credit impairment as 
outlined in the FASB™s proposed Accounting Standard UpdateŠ

Financial InstrumentsŒCredit Losses (Subtopic 825-15) issued on 
December 20, 2012. Scoring systems, various analytical tools and 
portfolio performance monitoring are used to assess the credit risk 

in the Bancorp™s homogenous consumer and small business loan 
portfolios.  Overview 
Economic growth is improving and GDP is expected to maintain its 

modest expansionary pattern. The job market is slowly but steadily 

improving. Housing prices have largely stabilized and are increasing 
in many markets, but overall current economic conditions are 

causing weaker than desired qualified loan demand and a relatively 
low interest rate environment, which directly impacts the Bancorp™s 
growth and profitability.  
Among consumer portfolios, residential mortgage and 
brokered home equity portfolios exhibited the most stress. As of 

December 31, 2014, consumer real estate loans originated from 
2005 through 2008 represent approximately 24% of the consumer 
real estate portfolio and approximately 68% of total losses in 2014. 

Loss rates continue to improve as newer vintages are performing 

within expectations. With the stabilization of certain real estate 
markets, the Bancorp began to selectively originate new 
homebuilder and developer lending and nonowner-occupied 
commercial lending in the third quarter of 2011. Currently, the level 

of new commercial real estate fundings is slightly above the 
amortization and pay-off of the portfolio. The Bancorp continues to 
aggressively engage in other loss mitigation strategies such as 

reducing credit commitments, restructuring certain commercial and 

consumer loans, as well as utilizing commercial and consumer loan 
workout teams. For commercial and consumer loans owned by the 
Bancorp, loan modification strategies are developed that are 

workable for both the borrower and the Bancorp when the 
borrower displays a willingness to cooperate. These strategies 
typically involve either a reduction of the stated interest rate of the 

loan, an extension of the loan™s maturity date(s) with a stated rate 

lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, 

or in limited circumstances, a reduction of the principal balance of 
the loan or the loan™s accrued interest. For residential mortgage 
loans serviced for FHLMC and FNMA, the Bancorp participates in 

the HAMP and HARP 2.0 programs. For loans refinanced under 

the HARP 2.0 program, the Bancorp strictly adheres to the 

underwriting requirements of the program and promptly sells the 

refinanced loan back to the agencies. Loan restructuring under the 

HAMP program is performed on behalf of FHLMC or FNMA and 
the Bancorp does not take possession of these loans during the 
modification process. Therefore, participation in these programs 

does not significantly impact the Bancorp™s credit quality statistics. 

The Bancorp participates in trial modifications in conjunction with 

the HAMP program for loans it services for FHLMC and FNMA. 

As these trial modifications relate to loans serviced for others, they 
are not included in the Bancorp™s TDRs as they are not assets of the 
Bancorp. In the event there is a representation and warranty 
violation on loans sold through the programs, the Bancorp may be 

required to repurchase the sold loan. As of December 31, 2014, 

repurchased loans restructured or refinanced under these programs 

were immaterial to the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial 

Statements. Additionally, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, $22 
million and $111 million, respectively, of loans refinanced under 
HARP 2.0 were included in loans held for sale in the Bancorp™s 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 

2014 and 2013, the Bancorp recognized $13 million and $97 million, 

respectively, of noninterest income in mortgage banking net revenue 

in the Bancorp™s Consolidated Statements of Income related to the 

sale of loans restructured or refinanced under the HAMP and 
HARP 2.0 programs. In the financial services industry, there has been heightened 
focus on foreclosure activity and processes. The Bancorp actively 
works with borrowers experiencing difficulties and has regularly 

modified or provided forbearance to borrowers where a workable 

solution could be found. Foreclosure is a last resort, and the 

Bancorp undertakes foreclosures only when it believes they are 

necessary and appropriate and is careful to ensure that customer and 

loan data are accurate.  During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Bancorp settled certain 
repurchase claims related to mortgage loans originated and sold to 
FHLMC prior to January 1, 2009 for $25 million, after paid claim 

credits and other adjustments. The settlement removes the 

Bancorp™s responsibility to repurchase or indemnify FHLMC for 

representation and warranty violations on any loan sold prior to 
January 1, 2009 except in limited circumstances.  
 
Commercial Portfolio  
The Bancorp™s credit risk management strategy includes minimizing 
concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has 

commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of 

business within the commercial segment, geography and credit 
product type. The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is 
managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing 

detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, 
monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and 
continuous portfolio risk management reporting. The origination 

policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting 

requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction 

lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization 

terms, maximum LTVs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, 

construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, 

pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), sensitivity and pro-forma 
analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. The Bancorp 
requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-

party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and 

renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as 
needed basis when market conditions justify. Although the Bancorp 
does not back test these collateral value assumptions, the Bancorp 

maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-

party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. 
Collateral values on criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 
million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  60  Fifth Third Bancorp 
value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves. 
In addition, the Bancorp applies incremental valuation adjustments 

to older appraisals that relate to collateral dependent loans, which 

can currently be up to 20-30% of the appraised value based on the 
type of collateral. These incremental valuation adjustments generally 
reflect the age of the most recent appraisal as well as collateral type. 
Trends in collateral values, such as home price indices and recent 

asset dispositions, are monitored in order to determine whether 

changes to the appraisal adjustments are warranted. Other factors 
such as local market conditions or location may also be considered 
as necessary. 
The Bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate 
collateral securing a loan and considers all cross collateralized loans 
in the calculation of the LTV ratio. The following tables provide 
detail on the most recent LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans 

greater than $1 million, excluding impaired commercial mortgage 
loans individually evaluated. The Bancorp does not typically 

aggregate the LTV ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than 

$1 million.  TABLE 34: COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS OUTSTANDING BY LTV, LOANS GREATER THAN $1 MILLION

MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 63  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Consumer Portfolio
 The Bancorp™s consumer portfolio is materially comprised of three 

categories of loans: residential mortgage, home equity and 

automobile. The Bancorp has identified certain categories within 

these loan types which it believes represent a higher level of risk 

compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio due to high 
loan amount to collateral value.  The Bancorp does not update LTV 
ratios for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except 

as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans.  
 Residential Mortgage Portfolio The Bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage 

portfolio through conservative underwriting and documentation 
standards and geographic and product diversification. The Bancorp 
may also package and sell loans in the portfolio. 
The Bancorp does not originate mortgage loans that permit 
customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are 
less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed 
and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans. Resets of rates on 

ARMs are not expected to have a material impact on credit costs in 

the current interest rate environment, as approximately $900 million 

of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans will have rate resets 

during the next twelve months. Approximately three fourths of 
those resets are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an 
average increase of approximately an eighth of a percent. 
Certain residential mortgage products have contractual features 
that may increase credit exposure to the Bancorp in the event of a 

decline in housing values. These types of mortgage products offered 

by the Bancorp include loans with high LTV ratios, multiple loans 

on the same collateral that when combined result in a LTV greater 
than 80% and interest-only loans. The Bancorp has deemed 
residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% LTV ratios and no 
mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk. 
  The following table provides an analysis of the residential mortgage portfolio loans outstanding by LTV at origination:

   Home Equity Portfolio The Bancorp™s home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of 

home equity lines of credit. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, 

the Bancorp™s newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 
10-year interest only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization 
period. The home equity line of credit previously offered by the 

Bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum 

payments of interest only and a balloon payment of principal at 
maturity.  The ALLL provides coverage for probable and estimable losses 
in the home equity portfolio. The allowance attributable to the 
portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured 
in a TDR is calculated on a pooled basis with senior lien and junior 

lien categories segmented in the determination of the probable 

credit losses in the home equity portfolio. The modeled loss factor 

for the home equity portfolio is based on the trailing twelve month 
historical loss rate for each category, as adjusted for certain 
prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment 

factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. 

The prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for 

delinquency trends, LTV trends, refreshed FICO score trends and 

product mix. The qualitative factors include adjustments for credit 

administration and portfolio management, credit policy and 

underwriting and the national and local economy. The Bancorp 
considers home price index trends when determining the national 
and local economy qualitative factor. The home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: 
loans outstanding with a combined LTV greater than 80% and 

those loans with a LTV 80% or less based upon appraisals at 

origination. The carrying value of the greater than 80% LTV home 

equity loans and 80% or less LTV home equity loans were $3.0 

billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. Of 
the total $8.9 billion of outstanding home equity loans:  
84% reside within the Bancorp™s Midwest footprint of 
Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois; 34% are in senior lien positions and 66% are in junior lien 
positions at December 31, 2014; Approximately 90% of non-delinquent borrowers made at 
least one payment greater than the minimum payment 
during the year ended December 31, 2014; and 
The portfolio had an average refreshed
 FICO score of 740 
and 736 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.   
 The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes 
reductions in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on 

FICO score deterioration and property devaluation.  The Bancorp 
does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update 
LTV ratios after origination. However, the Bancorp monitors the 

local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and 

incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its on-
going credit monitoring processes. For junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the Bancorp tracks the 

performance of the senior lien loans in which the Bancorp is the 
servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor 
the status of the senior lien loans that the Bancorp does not service. 

If the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the 

junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless 

both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. 
Additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days 
or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more 
past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off, 
unless it is well-secured and in the process of collection. Refer to the 

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets section of MD&A for more 

information.

   Automobile Portfolio The automobile portfolio is characterized by direct and indirect 

lending products to consumers. As of December 31, 2014, 51% of 

the automobile loan portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by 
new automobiles. It is a common practice to advance on automobile 
loans an amount in excess of the automobile value due to the 

inclusion of taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. The Bancorp 

monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans.

    European Exposure  
The Bancorp has no direct sovereign exposure to any European 

government as of December 31, 2014.  In providing services to our 
customers, the Bancorp routinely enters into financial transactions 
with foreign domiciled and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign businesses as 

well as foreign financial institutions.  These financial transactions are 

in the form of loans, loan commitments, letters of credit, derivatives 
and securities.  The Bancorp™s risk appetite for foreign country 
exposure is managed by having established country exposure limits. 

The Bancorp™s total exposure to European domiciled or owned 

businesses and European financial institutions was $4.4 billion and 
funded exposure was $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2014.  
Additionally, the Bancorp was within its established country 

exposure limits for all European countries.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets 
Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for 

which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal 

and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial and credit card 

loans which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a 

performing asset; restructured consumer loans which are 90 days 
past due based on the restructured terms unless the loan is both 
well-secured and in the process of collection; and certain other 

assets, including OREO and other repossessed property. A 

summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 49. For 

further information on the Bancorp™s policies related to accounting 
for delinquent and nonperforming loans refer to the Nonaccrual 
Loans and Leases section of Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated 

Financial Statements. 
Total nonperforming assets, including loans held for sale, were 
$783 million at December 31 2014 compared to $986 million at 

December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, $39 million of 

nonaccrual loans, consisting primarily of real estate secured loans, 

were held for sale, compared to $6 million at December 31, 2013.  
Total nonperforming assets, including loans held for sale, as a 
percentage of total loans, leases and other assets, including OREO 

as of December 31, 2014 were 0.86%, compared to 1.10% as of 
December 31, 2013. Excluding nonaccrual loans held for sale, 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of portfolio loans, leases and 

other assets, including OREO were 0.82% as of December 31, 

2014, compared to 1.10% as of December 31, 2013. The 
composition of nonaccrual loans and leases continues to be 

concentrated in real estate as 50% of nonaccrual loans and leases 
were secured by real estate as of December 31, 2014 compared to 

60% as of December 31, 2013.  
Commercial nonperforming loans and leases were $391 million 
at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $73 million from December 31, 

2013 as charge-offs, loan paydowns/payoffs, loan transfers to 
performing and loans sold from the portfolio outpaced new 
nonaccruals. Excluding commercial nonperforming loans and leases 

held for sale, commercial nonperforming loans and leases at 

December 31, 2014 decreased $91 million compared to December 

31, 2013. Consumer nonperforming loans and leases were $227 million 
at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $66 million from December 31, 

2013 as loan pay downs/payoffs, charge-offs and transfers to 
performing and OREO outpaced new nonaccrual loans. Excluding 
consumer nonperforming loans and leases held for sale, consumer 

nonperforming loans and leases at December 31, 2014 decreased 

$81 million compared to December 31, 2013. Geographical market 

conditions continue to be a large driver of nonaccrual activity as 
Florida properties represent approximately 11% and seven percent 
of residential mortgage and home equity balances, respectively, but 
represent 32% and 15% of nonaccrual loans for each category at 
December 31, 2014. Refer to Table 50 for a rollforward of the 

nonperforming loans and leases. 
OREO and other repossessed property was $165 million at 
December 31, 2014, compared to $229 million at December 31, 

2013. The Bancorp recognized $26 million and $45 million in losses 
on the sale or write-down of OREO properties in 2014 and 2013, 
respectively. The decrease from the prior year was primarily due to a 

modest improvement in general economic conditions.  
In 2014 and 2013, approximately $49 million and $71 million, 
respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the 

nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual status 

had been current in accordance with their original terms. Although 

these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual 
credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of 
interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below 
their principal balance. MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the Bancorp may 

consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan 
to maximize collection of amounts due. Typically, these 
modifications reduce the loan interest rate, extend the loan term, 
reduce the accrued interest or in limited circumstances, reduce the 
principal balance of the loan. These modifications are classified as 

TDRs. At the time of modification, the Bancorp maintains certain 
consumer loan TDRs (including residential mortgage loans, home 

equity loans, and other consumer loans) on accrual status, provided 

there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance 

according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-
documented credit evaluation. Commercial loans modified as part 
of a TDR are maintained on accrual status provided there is a 

sustained payment history of six months or greater prior to the 
modification in accordance with the modified terms and all 
remaining contractual payments under the modified terms are 

reasonably assured of collection. TDRs of commercial loans and 
credit card loans that do not have a sustained payment history of six 
months or greater in accordance with the modified terms remain on 
nonaccrual status until a six month payment history is sustained.  
Consumer restructured loans on accrual status totaled $905 
million and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 

2013, respectively. The decrease from the prior year was primarily 

due to the transfer of $720 million of restructured residential 

mortgage loans from the portfolio to loans held for sale during the 
fourth quarter of 2014. As a result of the transfer, the Bancorp 
recognized a charge-off of $87 million in 2014. As of December 31, 
2014, the percentage of restructured residential mortgage loans, 
home equity loans, and credit card loans that are past due 30 days or 

more were 40%, 12% and 33%, respectively.  The following tables summarize TDRs by loan type and delinquency status:

A Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs 
Net charge-offs were 64 bps and 58 bps of average portfolio loans 

and leases for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, 
respectively. Table 53 provides a summary of credit loss experience 
and net charge-offs as a percentage of average portfolio loans and 
leases outstanding by loan category. The ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs to 
average portfolio commercial loans and leases increased to 48 bps 

during 2014 compared to 44 bps in 2013, as a result of increases in 

net charge-offs of $41 million partially offset by an increase in 

average commercial loan and lease balances of $3.4 billion. The 
increase in net charge-offs during 2014 was driven primarily by an 
increase in charge-offs on certain commercial and industrial loans, 
primarily due to $96 million in aggregate net charge-offs related to 
six impaired commercial and industrial loans in the first and third 

quarters of 2014. The increases in commercial and industrial loan 

and commercial construction loan net charge-offs during 2014 were 

partially offset by a decrease in commercial mortgage loan net 
charge-offs, compared to 2013, due to improvements in general 
economic conditions and previous actions taken by the Bancorp to 
address problem loans. Net charge-offs for 2014 related to 
nonowner-occupied commercial real estate were $18 million 

compared to $27 million in 2013. Net charge-offs related to 

nonowner-occupied commercial real estate are recorded in the 

commercial mortgage loans and commercial construction loans 
captions in Table 53. Net charge-offs on these loans represented 
seven percent of total commercial loan and lease net charge-offs in 

2014 and 12% in 2013.  
The ratio of consumer loan and lease net charge-offs to 
average consumer loans and leases increased to 86 bps in 2014 

compared to 77 bps in 2013. Net charge-offs on residential 

mortgage loans, which typically involve partial charge-offs based 
upon appraised values of underlying collateral, increased $66 million 
from the prior year. The increase in net charge-offs on residential 
mortgage loans was primarily due to an $87 million charge-off 

related to the transfer of certain residential mortgage loans from the 

portfolio to held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially 

offset by improvements in delinquencies and loss severities. The 

Bancorp expects the composition of the residential mortgage 
portfolio to improve as it continues to retain high quality, shorter 
duration residential mortgage loans that are originated through its 
branch network as a low-cost, refinance product of conforming 

residential mortgage loans. Home equity net charge-offs decreased $38 million compared 
to the prior year, primarily due to improvements in loss severities. 

In addition, management actively manages lines of credit and makes 
reductions in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on 
FICO score deterioration and property devaluation.  
Automobile loan net charge-offs increased $5 million 
compared to 2013 due to increased delinquencies and losses in the 

indirect portfolio. Credit card net charge-offs increased $4 million 

from 2013. The Bancorp utilizes a risk-adjusted pricing 

methodology to ensure adequate compensation is received for those 

products that have higher credit costs.

          Allowance for Credit Losses 
The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the 
reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL provides coverage 
for probable and estimable losses in the loan and lease portfolio. 

The Bancorp evaluates the ALLL each quarter to determine its 

adequacy to cover inherent losses. Several factors are taken into 
consideration in the determination of the overall ALLL, including 
an unallocated component. These factors include, but are not 

limited to, the overall risk profile of the loan and lease portfolios, 

net charge-off experience, the extent of impaired loans and leases, 
the level of nonaccrual loans and leases, the level of 90 days past 
due loans and leases and the overall level of the ALLL as a 

percentage of loans. The Bancorp also considers overall asset quality 

trends, credit administration and portfolio management practices, 
risk identification practices, credit policy and underwriting practices, 
overall portfolio growth, portfolio concentrations and current 
national and local economic conditions that might impact the 
portfolio. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section of 
MD&A for more information. In 2014, the Bancorp did not substantively change any material 
aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the ALLL and 

there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation 

techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the 

determination of the current period allowance. In addition to the 

ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments 
recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 
methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is 

similar to the Bancorp™s methodology for determining the ALLL. 

The provision for unfunded commitments is included in other 
noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  72  Fifth Third Bancorp 
The ALLL attributable to the portion of the residential 
mortgage and consumer loan and lease portfolio that has not been 

restructured is determined on a pooled basis with the segmentation 

based on the similarity of credit risk characteristics. Loss factors for 
real estate backed consumer loans are developed for each pool 
based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate, as adjusted 
for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative 

adjustment factors. The prescriptive loss rate factors and qualitative 

adjustments are designed to reflect risks associated with current 

conditions and trends which are not believed to be fully reflected in 

the trailing twelve month historical loss rate. For real estate backed 

consumer loans, the prescriptive loss rate factors include 
adjustments for delinquency trends, LTV trends, refreshed FICO 
score trends and product mix, and the qualitative factors include 
adjustments for credit administration and portfolio management 

practices, credit policy and underwriting practices and the national 

and local economy. The Bancorp considers home price index trends 

in its footprint when determining the national and local economy 
qualitative factor. The Bancorp also considers the volatility of 
collateral valuation trends when determining the unallocated 
component of the ALLL. 
The Bancorp™s determination of the ALLL for commercial 
loans is sensitive to the risk grades it assigns to these loans. In the 

event that 10% of commercial loans in each risk category would 

experience a downgrade of one risk category, the allowance for 
commercial loans would increase by approximately $162 million at 
December 31, 2014. In addition, the Bancorp™s determination of the 
allowance for residential and consumer loans is sensitive to changes 

in estimated loss rates. In the event that estimated loss rates would 
increase by 10%, the allowance for residential and consumer loans 

would increase by approximately $34 million at December 31, 2014. 

As several qualitative and quantitative factors are considered in 
determining the ALLL, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily 
reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ALLL. They 
are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes 

to risk grades and estimated loss rates and do not imply any 
expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. 

Given current processes employed by the Bancorp, management 

believes the risk grades and estimated loss rates currently assigned 

are appropriate.  TABLE 54: CHANGES IN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

    Certain inherent, but unconfirmed losses are probable within the 
loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp™s current methodology for 

determining the level of losses is based on historical loss rates, 

current credit grades, specific allocation on impaired commercial 

credits above specified thresholds and restructured loans and other 

qualitative adjustments. Due to the heavy reliance on realized 
historical losses and the credit grade rating process, the model-
derived estimate of ALLL tends to slightly lag behind the 

deterioration in the portfolio, in a stable or deteriorating credit 

environment, and tend not to be as responsive when improved 

conditions have presented themselves. Given these model 
limitations, the qualitative adjustment factors may be incremental or 
decremental to the quantitative model results.  
An unallocated component to the ALLL is maintained to 
recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss. The 

unallocated allowance as a percent of total portfolio loans and leases 

at both December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 0.12%. The unallocated 
allowance was eight percent of the total allowance as of December 
31, 2014 compared to seven percent as of December 31, 2013.  
As shown in Table 55, the ALLL as a percent of portfolio 
loans and leases was 1.47% at December 31, 2014, compared to 

1.79% at December 31, 2013. The ALLL was $1.3 billion as of 

December 31, 2014, compared to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2013. 

The decrease was reflective of decreases in nonperforming loans 

and leases and improved delinquency metrics in commercial and 

consumer loans and leases.

          MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 
Market risk arises from the potential for market fluctuations in 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices that may 
result in potential reductions in net income. Interest rate risk, a 

component of market risk, is the exposure to adverse changes in net 
interest income or financial position due to changes in interest rates. 
Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in 

terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk can occur 

for any one or more of the following reasons: 
 Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times; Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts; or  
The expected maturity of various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. 
 In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on net 
interest income, interest rates can indirectly impact earnings through 
their effect on loan demand, credit losses, mortgage originations, the 
value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorp™s 

earnings. Stability of the Bancorp™s net income is largely dependent 

upon the effective management of interest rate risk. Management 
continually reviews the Bancorp™s balance sheet composition and 
earnings flows and models the interest rate risk, and possible actions 

to reduce this risk, given numerous possible future interest rate 

scenarios. Interest Rate Risk Management Oversight
 The Bancorp™s Executive ALCO, which includes senior 
management representatives and is accountable to the ERM 
Committee, monitors and manages interest rate risk within Board 

approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities 
of ALCO, the Bancorp has a Market Risk Management function as 
part of ERM that provides independent oversight of market risk 

activities. 

 Net Interest Income Sensitivity
 The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to 
identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII 

simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to 

changing interest rates. The model is based on contractual and 

assumed cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the 
Bancorp™s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and 
incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of 

changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and 
attrition rates of certain liabilities. The model also includes senior 
management™s projections of the future volume and pricing of each 

of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other 

pertinent assumptions. Actual results may differ from simulated 

results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate 
changes as well as changes in market conditions and management 
strategies. MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  74  Fifth Third Bancorp 
The Bancorp™s interest rate risk exposure is evaluated by 
measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over 12-

month and 24-month horizons assuming 100 bps and 200 bps 

parallel ramped increases in interest rates. In accordance with 
internal policy, rate movements are assumed to occur over one year 
and are sustained thereafter. The analysis would typically include 
100 bps and 200 bps parallel ramped decreases in interest rates; 
however, this analysis is currently omitted due to the current low 

levels of certain interest rates. Applying the ramps would result in 

certain interest rates becoming negative in the parallel ramped 
decrease scenarios.  
 The following table shows the Bancorp™s estimated NII sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of December 31:
                                 TABLE 56: ESTIMATED NII SENSITIVITY PROFILE

           At December 31, 2014, the Bancorp™s net interest income would 
benefit in year one and year two under these parallel ramp increases. 

The benefit was attributable to the combination of floating-rate 

assets, including the predominantly floating-rate commercial loan 
portfolio, and certain intermediate-term fixed-rate liabilities. The 
benefit was up modestly compared to December 31, 2013 with the 

exception of the +200 scenario from 13 to 24 months, which was 

down slightly.  Improvements in the NII benefit were attributable to 
continued growth in commercial loans and core deposits, and the 
issuance of fixed-rate debt securities.  The modest decline in the 

+200 scenario from 13 to 24 months compared to December 31, 
2013 was primarily due to changes in expected loan and security 
prepayment speeds. 
 Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity
 The Bancorp also uses EVE as a measurement tool in managing 
interest rate risk. Whereas the net interest income sensitivity analysis 
highlights the impact on forecasted NII over one and two year time 
horizons, the EVE analysis is a point in time analysis of the current 

positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated 

remaining lives. The EVE of the balance sheet is defined as the 
discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows 
less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. Due to this 

longer horizon, the sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of 

interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk.  EVE 
values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the 
growth assumptions used in the NII sensitivity analysis. As with the 

NII simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability 

of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. 
Particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security 
prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of 

transaction deposits. 
 The following table shows the Bancorp™s EVE sensitivity profile as of December 31:
                TABLE 57: ESTIMATED EVE SENSITIVITY PROFILE

   -25  
(0.05)     0.63 
       The EVE sensitivity was modestly negative at December 31, 2014 
and has improved from the EVE sensitivity at December 31, 2013. 
The lower level of EVE risk since December 31, 2013 was 
attributable to continued growth in commercial loans and core 

deposits, and the issuance of fixed-rate debt securities. 
While an instantaneous shift in interest rates was used in this 
analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes 
that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest 

impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash 

flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE 
does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be 
impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). 

Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future 

balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield 
curve relationships and changing product spreads that could 
mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. The 

NII simulations and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain 
actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response 
to anticipated changes in interest rates. 
The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to LIBOR and 
Prime basis risks, nonparallel shifts in the yield curve and embedded 

options risk. In addition, the impact on NII and EVE of extreme 

changes in interest rates is modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs 

the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios. 
Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk 
An integral component of the Bancorp™s interest rate risk 

management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize 

significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market 
interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp 
may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include 

interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward 
contracts, options, swaptions and TBA securities.  
 MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 75  Fifth Third Bancorp 
As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its 
mortgage banking activity, the Bancorp enters into forward 

contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically 

hedge IRLCs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. 

Additionally, the Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to 

mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts 
and mortgage options.  
The Bancorp also establishes derivative contracts with major 
financial institutions to economically hedge significant exposures 

assumed in commercial customer accommodation derivative 

contracts. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to 

protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from 

the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their 

contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral 
arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. For 
further information including the notional amount and fair values of 

these derivatives, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated 

Financial Statements 
Portfolio Loans and Leases and Interest Rate Risk 
Although the Bancorp™s portfolio loans and leases contain both 
fixed and floating/adjustable rate products, the rates of interest 
earned by the Bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally 

established for a period of time. The interest rate sensitivity of loans 

and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is 
established. The following table summarizes the expected cash flows 
of the carrying value of the Bancorp™s portfolio loans and leases as

    Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Interest Rate Risk 
The net carrying amount of the residential MSR portfolio was $856 
million and $967 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, 

respectively. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply 

depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, 
as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of 
refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines 

because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans. The 

Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its 

mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk 

associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result 

of changing interest rates. 
Mortgage rates decreased during the year ended December 31, 
2014 which caused actual prepayments on the servicing portfolio to 
increase. The increase in actual prepayments on the servicing 
portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2014 caused the 

modeled prepayment speeds to increase, which led to a temporary 

impairment of $65 million on servicing rights during the year ended 

December 31, 2014. Mortgage rates increased during the year ended 
December 31, 2013 which caused actual prepayments on the 
servicing portfolio to decrease. The decrease in actual prepayments 

on the servicing portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2013 
caused the modeled prepayment speeds to decrease, which led to a 
recovery of temporary impairment of $192 million on servicing 

rights during the year ended December 31, 2013. Servicing rights are deemed temporarily impaired when a 
borrower™s loan rate is distinctly higher than prevailing rates. 
Temporary impairment on servicing rights is reversed when the 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  76  Fifth Third Bancorp 
prevailing rates return to a level commensurate with the borrower™s 
loan rate. In addition to the mortgage servicing rights valuation, the 

Bancorp recognized net gains of $95 million and net losses of $17 

million on its non-qualifying hedging strategy for the years ended 
2014 and 2013, respectively. These amounts include net gains on 
securities related to the Bancorp™s non-qualifying hedging strategy 
which were zero during 2014 and $13 million during 2013. The 

Bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of 

the composition of its MSR portfolio, the cost of hedging and the 

anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic 

environment. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated 

Financial Statements for further discussion on servicing rights and 
the instruments used to hedge interest rate risk on MSRs.
Foreign Currency Risk 
The Bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts 
to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The 
derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the 
revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income 

in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the 

Bancorp™s foreign denominated loans at December 31, 2014 and 
December 31, 2013 was $720 million and $581 million, respectively. 
The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the 
benefit of commercial customers involved in international trade to 

hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Bancorp 

has internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not 

being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls 

include an independent determination of currency volatility and 

credit equivalent exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit 
approvals and country limits. LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 
The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to 

meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of 

deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating 

liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the 
form of investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused 
borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent 

growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and 

commitments to make future payments under contracts is included 

in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that 
assesses the liquidity needs under various scenarios of market 

conditions, asset growth and credit rating downgrades. The plan 
includes liquidity stress testing which measures various sources and 
uses of funds under the different scenarios. The contingency plan 

provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and 

available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected 

liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect 
liquidity. 
 Sources of Funds The Bancorp™s primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from 

loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales 

and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and 
funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public 
and private debt offerings. Expected maturities from loan and lease repayments are 
included in Table 58 of the Market Risk Management section of 

MD&A. Of the $22.4 billion of securities in the Bancorp™s available-
for-sale and other portfolio at December 31, 2014, $3.3 billion in 
principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 

months and an additional $3.5 billion is expected to be received in 
the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorp™s 
securities portfolio, refer to the Investment Securities subsection of 

the Balance Sheet Analysis of MD&A. Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorp™s ability to 
sell or securitize loans and leases. In order to reduce the exposure to 
interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has 
developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of 

interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate 
single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to 
FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. 

Additional assets such as certain other residential mortgages, certain 

commercial loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other 

consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. For the 
years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp sold or 
securitized loans totaling $9.4 billion and $23.4 billion, respectively. 
For further information on the transfer of financial assets, refer to 
Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a 
sizeable source of relatively stable and low cost funds. The 
Bancorp™s average core deposits and shareholders™ equity funded 
82% of its average total assets during 2014 and 2013. In addition to 
core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other 

short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of 

the FHLB system. Certificates of deposit with a balance of $100,000 

or more and deposits in the Bancorp™s foreign branch located in the 

Cayman Islands are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset 
growth. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity 
and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet 
needs. On February 25, 2014, the Bancorp issued and sold $500 
million of unsecured senior fixed-rate notes. On June 5, 2014, The 

Bancorp issued in a registered public offering 300,000 depositary 

shares, representing 12,000 shares of 4.90% fixed-to-floating rate 
non-cumulative Series J perpetual preferred stock, for net proceeds 
of $297 million. As of December 31, 2014, $3.0 billion of debt or 

other securities were available for issuance under the current 
Bancorp™s Board of Directors™ authorizations and the Bancorp is 
authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the SEC 

to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, 

access to these markets may depend on market conditions. At 
December 31, 2014, the Bancorp has approximately $41.7 billion of 
borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources 

including the FHLB and FRB. 
In 2013, the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary updated and 
amended its existing global bank note program to increase the 
capacity from $20 billion to $25 billion. On April 25, 2014, the Bank 

issued and sold $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 

unsecured senior bank notes. On September 5, 2014, the Bank 
issued and sold $850 million of unsecured senior fixed-rate bank 
notes. The Bancorp has $19.1 billion of funding available for 

issuance under the global bank note program as of December 31, 

2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Bancorp transferred approximately $3.8 billion in consumer automobile loans 

to bankruptcy remote trusts which were deemed to be VIEs. The 

Bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of these VIEs 

and, therefore, has consolidated these VIEs. The assets of these 

VIEs are restricted to the settlement of the notes and other 

obligations of the VIEs. Third-party holders of the notes do not 

have recourse to the general assets of the Bancorp.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio  
A key reform within the Basel III framework to strengthen 
international liquidity standards was the introduction of the LCR 

and NSFR. On January 7, 2013, the BCBS issued a final standard 

for the LCR applicable to large internationally active banking 

organizations. The BCBS plans on implementing the NSFR in 2018. 
Section 165 of the DFA requires the FRB to establish 
enhanced liquidity standards in the U.S. for BHCs with total assets 

of $50 billion or greater. On October 10, 2014, the U.S. Banking 

Agencies published final rules implementing a quantitative liquidity 

requirement consistent with the LCR standard established by the 

BCBS for large internationally active banking organizations, 
generally those with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets 

or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure. In 
addition, a modified LCR requirement was finalized for BHCs with 
$50 billion or more in total consolidated assets that are not 

internationally active, such as Fifth Third. The Modified LCR 

requires BHCs to maintain HQLA equal to its calculated net cash 

outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress period multiplied by a factor 
of 0.7. The modified LCR is effective January 1, 2016 and requires 
BHCs to calculate its LCR on a monthly basis. The final rule 

includes a transition period for the modified LCR in which BHCs 
must maintain HQLA of 90% of its calculated net cash outflows for 
2016 and then 100% beginning in 2017. The Bancorp estimates its 
modified LCR was 112% at December 31, 2014 calculated under 
the modified LCR final rule. For more information on LCR, refer to 

the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.  
Credit Ratings 
The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp are impacted 

by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorp™s credit ratings 
could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its 
borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorp™s 

financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high 

credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong 

credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in 

addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. 
The Bancorp™s credit ratings are summarized in Table 60. The 
ratings reflect the ratings agencies view on the Bancorp™s capacity to 
meet financial commitments. *  
 * As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a 
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision 

or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each 

rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Additional 

information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is 

located on the website of each credit rating agency.

          OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Bancorp faces ongoing and emerging risks and regulations 
related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and 

financial products. The Bancorp believes that effective management 

of operational risk plays a major role in both the level and the 
stability of profitability. Operational risk is the risk of loss from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from 

external events. This includes, but is not limited to, the following 

types of risk:  business continuity risk, information management 
risk, fraud risk, model risk, third party service provider risk, human 
resources risk, and process risk.
The Bancorp™s risk management framework consists of five 
integrated components, including identifying, assessing, managing, 
monitoring, and reporting risks. The Operational Risk Management 
function is responsible for developing and overseeing the 

implementation of the Bancorp™s approach to managing operational 
risk.  This includes providing training, tools, guidance and oversight 
to support implementation of key risk programs and systems as they 
relate to operational risk management, such as risk and control self-

assessments, new product/initiative risk reviews, key risk indicators, 

and operational losses. The function is also responsible for 

developing reports that support the proactive management of 

operational risk across the enterprise.  The lines of business and 

corporate functions are responsible for managing the operational 

risks associated with their areas in accordance with the risk 
management framework. The framework is intended to enable the 
Bancorp to function with a sound and well-controlled operational 

environment. These processes support the Bancorp™s goals to 

minimize future operational losses and strengthen the Bancorp™s 
performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational 
losses that are incurred.  
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  
Management regularly reviews the Bancorp™s capital levels to help 
ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating 

environments. The Bancorp has established a Capital Committee 

which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to 
management. These recommendations are reviewed by the ERM 
Committee and the capital plan is approved by the Board of 

Directors. The Capital Committee is responsible for execution 

oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan. 
 Capital Ratios 
The U.S banking agencies established quantitative measures that 
assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items and also 

define and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. The U.S. 

banking agencies define ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ ratios for Tier I and Total 
risk-based capital as 6% and 10%, respectively. The Bancorp 
exceeded these ﬁwell-capitalizedﬂ ratios for all periods presented. 
The Basel II advanced approach framework was finalized by 
U.S. banking agencies in 2007. Core banks, defined as those with 
consolidated total assets in excess of $250 billion or on balance 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  78  Fifth Third Bancorp 
sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion were required to adopt the 
advanced approach effective April 1, 2008. The Bancorp does not 

meet these thresholds and, therefore, is not subject to the 

requirements of Basel II. The DFA requires more stringent prudential standards, 
including capital and liquidity requirements, for larger institutions. It 
addresses the quality of capital components by limiting the degree to 

which certain hybrid instruments can be included. The DFA will 

phase out the inclusion of certain TruPS as a component of Tier I 

risk-based capital when the Bancorp implements the revised 

regulatory capital rules known as Basel III. In December of 2010 and revised in June of 2011, the BCBS 
issued Basel III, a global regulatory framework, to enhance 
international capital standards. In June of 2012, U.S. banking 
regulators proposed enhancements to the regulatory capital 

requirements for U.S. banks, which implement aspects of Basel III, 

such as re-defining the regulatory capital elements and minimum 

capital ratios, introducing regulatory capital buffers above those 
minimums, revising the agencies™ rules for calculating risk-weighted 
assets and introducing a new Tier I common equity ratio. In July of 
2013, U.S. banking regulators approved final enhanced regulatory 
capital requirements (Basel III Final Rule), which included 

modifications to the proposed rules. The Basel III Final Rule 

provides for certain banks, including the Bancorp, to opt out of 

including AOCI in Tier I capital and retain the treatment of 

residential mortgage exposures consistent with the current Basel I 
capital rules. The Basel III Final Rule phases out the inclusion of 
certain TruPS as a component of Tier I capital. Under these 
provisions, these TruPS qualify as a component of Tier II capital. At 
December 31, 2014 the Bancorp™s Tier I capital included $60 million 

of TruPS representing approximately 5 bps of risk-weighted assets. 
The Basel III Final Rule is effective for the Bancorp as of January 1, 
2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain of its components and 

other provisions.  
The Bancorp™s current estimate of the pro-forma fully phased 
in Tier I common equity ratio at December 31, 2014 under the 
Basel III Final Rule is approximately 9.39% compared with 9.65% 
as calculated under the existing Basel I capital framework. The 

primary drivers of the change from the existing Basel I capital 

framework to the Basel III Final Rule are an increase in Tier I 

common equity of approximately 74 bps (primarily from the 

elimination of the current 10% deduction of mortgage servicing 
rights from capital), which would be more than offset by the impact 
of increases in risk-weighted assets (primarily from the treatment of 
securitizations, mortgage servicing rights and commitments with an 

original maturity of one year or less). If the Bancorp elected to 
include AOCI components in capital, the December 31, 2014 pro 

forma Basel III Final Rule Tier I common ratio would have 

increased by approximately 35 bps. The pro-forma Tier I common 

equity ratio exceeds the proposed minimum Tier I common equity 
ratio of 7% comprised of a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital 
conservation buffer of 2.5%. The pro-forma Tier I common equity 
ratio does not include the effect of any mitigating actions the 

Bancorp may undertake to offset the impact of the proposed capital 

enhancements. Additionally, pursuant to the Basel III Final Rule, 

the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 are 6% for the Tier 

I capital ratio, 8% for the Total risk-based capital ratio and 4% for 
the Tier I capital to average consolidated assets (leverage ratio). For 
further discussion on the Basel I and Basel III Tier I common 
equity ratios, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of 
MD&A.  TABLE 61: CAPITAL RATIOS

Preferred Stock Offering and Conversion 
As contemplated by the 2013 CCAR, on May 16, 2013 the Bancorp 
issued in a registered public offering 600,000 depositary shares, 

representing 24,000 shares of 5.10% fixed-to-floating rate non-

cumulative Series H perpetual preferred stock, for net proceeds of 
$593 million. Each preferred share has a $25,000 liquidation 
preference. The preferred stock accrues dividends, on a non-
cumulative semi-annual basis, at an annual rate of 5.10% through 
but excluding June 30, 2023, at which time it converts to a quarterly 

floating rate dividend of three-month LIBOR plus 3.033%. Subject 

to any required regulatory approval, the Bancorp may redeem the 

Series H preferred shares at its option in whole or in part, at any 

time on or after June 30, 2023 and may redeem in whole, but not in 

part, following a regulatory capital event at any time prior to June 
30, 2023. The Series H preferred shares are not convertible into 
Bancorp common shares or any other securities.  

 On June 11, 2013, the Bancorp™s Board of Directors authorized 

the conversion into common stock, no par value, of all outstanding 

shares of the Bancorp™s 8.50% non-cumulative convertible perpetual 

preferred stock, Series G, which shares are represented by 
depositary shares each representing 1/250th of a share of Series G 
preferred stock, pursuant to the Amended Articles of Incorporation. 
The Articles grant the Bancorp the right, at its option, to convert all 

outstanding shares of Series G preferred stock if the closing price of 

common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price 

for 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days. 

The closing price of shares of common stock satisfied such 
threshold for the 30 trading days ended June 10, 2013, and the 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 79  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Bancorp gave the required notice of its exercise of its conversion 
right.  
 On July 1, 2013, the Bancorp converted the remaining 16,442 

outstanding shares of Series G preferred stock, which represented 

4,110,500 depositary shares, into shares of Fifth Third™s common 

stock. Each share of Series G preferred stock was converted into 
2,159.8272 shares of common stock, representing a total of 
35,511,740 issued shares. The common shares issued in the 

conversion are exempt securities pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the 

Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the securities exchanged were 

exclusively with Bancorp™s existing security holders where no 

commission or other remuneration was paid. Upon conversion, the 

depositary shares were delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select 

Market and withdrawn from the Exchange. 
 On December 9, 2013, the Bancorp issued, in a registered 
public offering, 18,000,000 depositary shares, representing 18,000 

shares of 6.625% fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative Series I 

perpetual preferred stock, for net proceeds of $441 million. Each 

preferred share has a $25,000 liquidation preference. The preferred 
stock accrues dividends, on a non-cumulative quarterly basis, at an 
annual rate of 6.625% through but excluding December 31, 2023, at 

which time it converts to a quarterly floating rate dividend of three-
month LIBOR plus 3.71%. Subject to any required regulatory 
approval, the Bancorp may redeem the Series I preferred shares at 

its option in whole or in part, at any time on or after December 31, 

2023 and may redeem in whole, but not in part, following a 

regulatory capital event at any time prior to December 31, 2023. The 

Series I preferred shares are not convertible into Bancorp common 

shares or any other securities. 

        As contemplated by the 2014 CCAR, on June 5, 2014, the 
Bancorp issued in a registered public offering 300,000 depositary 
shares, representing 12,000 shares of 4.90% fixed-to-floating rate 

non-cumulative Series J perpetual preferred stock, for net proceeds 
of $297 million. Each preferred share has a $25,000 liquidation 
preference. The preferred stock accrues dividends, on a non-

cumulative semi-annual basis, at an annual rate of 4.90% through 

but excluding September 30, 2019, at which time it converts to a 

quarterly floating rate dividend of three-month LIBOR plus 
3.129%. Subject to any required regulatory approval, the Bancorp 
may redeem the Series J preferred shares at its option in whole or in 

part, at any time on or after September 30, 2019, or at any time 

following a regulatory capital event. The Series J preferred shares are 

not convertible into Bancorp common shares or any other 
securities.  Redemption of TruPS 
The Bancorp redeemed all $750 million of the outstanding TruPS 

issued by Fifth Third Capital Trust IV on December 30, 2013. 
These securities had a distribution rate of 6.50% and a scheduled 
maturity date of April 1, 2067. Pursuant to the terms of the TruPS, 

the securities of Fifth Third Capital Trust IV were redeemable 
within ninety days of a Capital Treatment Event. The Bancorp 
determined that a Capital Treatment Event occurred upon the 

publication of a Final Rule regarding Regulatory Capital Rules 

jointly by the Federal Reserve System and the OCC. The 

redemption price was $1,000 per security, which reflected 100% of 
the liquidation amount, plus accrued and unpaid distributions to the 
actual redemption date of $10 million. The Bancorp recognized an 
$8 million loss on the extinguishment of this debt within other 
noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program  
The Bancorp™s common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase 

program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need 
to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to 
pay dividends, the need to comply with safe and sound banking 

practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. 
The Bancorp declared dividends per common share of $0.51 and 
$0.47 during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, 

respectively. The Bancorp entered into accelerated share repurchase 

transactions during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. 

Refer to the Overview section of MD&A and Note 23 of the Notes

 the Bancorp™s common stock through the open market or in any 
private transaction. The authorization does not include specific 
price targets or an expiration date. This share repurchase aut
horization replaces the Board™s previous authorization pursuant to which 
approximately 35 million shares remained available for repurchase by the Bancorp. 
(b)In March 2013, the Bancorp announced that its Board of Directors had authorized management to purchase 100 million shares of
 the Bancorp™s common stock through the open market or in any 
private transaction. The authorization does not include specific 
price targets or an expiration date. This share repurchase aut
horization replaces the Board™s previous authorization pursuant to which 
approximately 54 million shares remained available for repurchase by the Bancorp. 
(c)Excludes 
2,116,370
, 1,863,097 and 2,059,003 shares repurchased during 
2014
, 2013 and 2012, respectively, in connection with various 
employee compensation plans. These repurchases are not 
included in the calculation for average price paid and do not count against the maximum number of shares that may yet be repurc
hased under the Board of Directors™ authorization. 
Stress Tests and CCAR In 2011, the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires 

BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit 

annual capital plans to the FRB for review.  Under the rule, these 
capital plans must included detailed descriptions of the following: 

the BHC™s internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the 
policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, 
dividends, and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions 
over a nine-quarter planning horizon.  Further, each BHC must also 
report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC 

under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of 

capital under baseline and stressed economic scenarios.  The FRB 
launched the 2014 stress testing program and CCAR on November 
1, 2013, with firm submissions of stress test results and capital plans 
due to the FRB on January 6, 2014, which the Bancorp submitted as 
required. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
MANAGEMENT™S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  80  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Statements for a discussion on the FRB™s review of the capital plan, 
the FRB™s non-objection to the Bancorp™s proposed capital actions 

and the Bancorp™s capital actions taken in 2014. The BHCs that participated in the 2014 CCAR, including the 
Bancorp, are required to conduct mid-cycle company-run stress 
tests using data as of March 31, 2014. The stress tests must be based 
on three BHC defined scenarios Œ baseline, adverse and severely 

adverse. As required, the Bancorp reported the mid-cycle stress test 

results to the FRB on July 7, 2014. In addition, the Bancorp 

published a Form 8-K providing a summary of the results under the 

severely adverse scenario on September 18, 2014, which is available 

on Fifth Third™s website at https://www.53.com
. These results 
represented estimates of the Bancorp™s results from the second 
quarter of 2014 through the second quarter of 2016 under the 

severely adverse scenario, which is considered highly unlikely to 

occur. The FRB launched the 2015 stress testing program and CCAR 
on October 23, 2014. The stress testing results and capital plan were 

submitted by the Bancorp to the FRB on January 5, 2015. 
The FRB expects to release summary results of the 2015 stress 
testing program and CCAR in March of 2015. The results will 
include supervisory projections of capital ratios, losses and revenues 

under the supervisory adverse and supervisory severely adverse 
scenarios. The FRB will also issue an objection or non-objection to 
each participating institution™s capital plan submitted under CCAR. 

The FRB™s summary results will also include an overview of 

methodologies used for supervisory tests.  Additionally, as a CCAR 

institution, Fifth Third is required to disclose its own estimates of 
results under the supervisory severely adverse scenario using the 
same consistently applied capital actions noted above, and to 

provide information related to risks included in its stress testing; a 
summary description of the methodologies used; estimates of 
aggregate pre-provision net revenue, losses, provisions, and pro 

forma capital ratios at the end of the forward-looking planning 

horizon of at least nine quarters; and an explanation of the most 

significant causes of changes in regulatory capital ratios. These 
disclosures are required to be sent to the FRB and publicly disclosed 
within 15 days of the date the FRB discloses the results of its DFA 
supervisory stress test.

 81  Fifth Third Bancorp 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
In the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into financial 
transactions that are considered off-balance sheet arrangements as 

they involve varying elements of market, credit and liquidity risk in 

excess of the amounts recognized in the Bancorp™s Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. The Bancorp™s off-balance sheet arrangements 
include commitments, contingent liabilities, guarantees, and 
transactions with non-consolidated VIEs. A brief discussion of 

these transactions is as follows: 
 
Commitments 

The Bancorp has certain commitments to make future payments 
under contracts, including commitments to extend credit, letters of 
credit, forward contracts related to held for sale mortgage loans, 
noncancelable lease obligations, capital commitments for private 
equity investments and purchase obligations. Refer to Note 17 of 

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 

information on commitments.  

 Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities 
For certain mortgage loans originated by the Bancorp, borrowers 
may be required to obtain PMI provided by third-party insurers. In 
some instances, these insurers cede a portion of the PMI premiums 

to the Bancorp, and the Bancorp provides reinsurance coverage 

within a specified range of the total PMI coverage. The Bancorp™s 

reinsurance coverage typically ranges from 5% to 10% of the total 

PMI coverage. The Bancorp™s maximum exposure in the event of 
nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the 
Bancorp™s total outstanding reinsurance coverage, which was $29 
million at December 31, 2014 and $37 million at December 31, 
2013. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp maintained a 
reserve of $2 million and $10 million, respectively, related to 

exposures within the reinsurance portfolio which was included in 

other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in 
the reserve was due to a decrease in both the outstanding exposure 
and expected losses. During 2009, the Bancorp suspended the 

practice of providing reinsurance of PMI for newly originated 
mortgage loans. The Bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence 
of certain events provided in certain contractual arrangements, 

including residential mortgage loans sold with representation and 

warranty provisions or credit recourse. Refer to Note 17 of the 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 

information on guarantees and contingent liabilities. 

 Transactions with Non-consolidated VIEs 
The Bancorp engages in a variety of activities that involve VIEs, 

which are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their 

activities, or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack any 
of the characteristics of a controlling interest. The investments in 
those entities in which the Bancorp was determined not to be the 

primary beneficiary but holds a variable interest in the entity are 

accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other 
accounting standards as appropriate and not consolidated. Refer to 
Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for 

additional information on non-consolidated VIEs.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS 
The Bancorp has certain obligations and commitments to make 
future payments under contracts. The aggregate contractual 
obligations and commitments at December 31, 2014 are shown in 
Table 63. As of December 31, 2014, the Bancorp has unrecognized 

tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate 
in future periods. Due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be 
ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, all uncertain 
tax liabilities that have not been paid have been excluded from the 
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments table. For further 
detail on the impact of income taxes refer to Note 20 of the Notes 

to Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENT™S ASSESSMENT AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 83  Fifth Third Bancorp 
The Bancorp conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Bancorp™s management, including th
e Bancorp™s 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Bancorp™s disclosu
re controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act). Based on the foregoing, as of the e
nd of the period 
covered by this report, the Bancorp™s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Bancorp™s disclosu
re controls and 
procedures were effective, in all material respects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Ban
corp files and submits 
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and information is accumulated and 
communicated to management on a timely basis. 
The management of Fifth Third Bancorp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control, designed to pr
ovide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Bancorp™s management assessed the effectiven
ess of the 
Bancorp™s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. Management™s assessment is based on the criteria e
stablished in the 
Internal Control Š Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and was 
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2014. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting a
s of December 31, 
2014. The Bancorp™s independent registered public accounting firm, that audited the Bancorp™s consolidated financial statements
 included in this 
annual report, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. This report
 appears on page 84 
of the annual report. 
The Bancorp™s management also conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any cha
nges occurred during the year covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, t
he Bancorp™s internal 
control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, there has been no such change during the year covered by this repor
t.

   REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 84  Fifth Third Bancorp 
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp: 
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the ﬁBancorpﬂ) as of Dec
ember 31, 2014, 
based on criteria established in 
Internal Control Š Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission. The Bancorp's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reportin
g and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management™s Assessm
ent as to the 
Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bancorp™s intern
al control over 
financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
 standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control ov
er financial 
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit includ
ed obtaining an understanding of internal control over finan
cial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal c
ontrol based on the 
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit 
provides a 
reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A company™s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company™s prin
cipal executive 
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company™s board of directors, ma
nagement, and other 
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial sta
tements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company™s internal control over financial reporting inc
ludes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the tra
nsactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to perm
it preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the com
pany are being 
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance re
garding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company™s assets that could have a mater
ial effect on the 
financial statements.  
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or imp
roper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, pr
ojections of any 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that
 the controls may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteri
orate. In our opinion, the Bancorp maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of Dec
ember 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in 
Internal ControlŠ Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Pu
blic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the co
nsolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 of the Bancorp and our report dated February 25, 2015 expre
ssed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
  Cincinnati, Ohio February 25, 2015 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp: 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the ﬁBancorpﬂ) as of Dece
mber 31, 2014 
and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three
 years in the 
period ended December 31, 2014. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Bancorp™s management. Our
 responsibility 
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Thos
e standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial st
atements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Fift
h Third Bancorp and 
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three y
ears in the period 
ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Ba
ncorp™s 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in 
Internal ControlŠIntegrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2015 expressed
 an 
unqualified opinion on the Bancorp™s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  90  Fifth Third Bancorp 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES 
Nature of Operations 
Fifth Third Bancorp, an Ohio corporation, conducts its principal 
lending, deposit gathering, transaction processing and service 

advisory activities through its banking and non-banking subsidiaries 

from banking centers located throughout the Midwestern and 
Southeastern regions of the United States. 
Basis of Presentation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the 
Bancorp and its majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs in which the 
Bancorp has been determined to be the primary beneficiary. Other 

entities, including certain joint ventures, in which the Bancorp has 

the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and 
financial policies of the investee, but upon which the Bancorp does 
not possess control, are accounted for by the equity method of 

accounting and not consolidated. The investments in those entities 

in which the Bancorp does not have the ability to exercise 
significant influence are generally carried at the lower of cost or fair 
value. Intercompany transactions and balances have been 

eliminated. 
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. 

GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions 

that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and 
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates. Cash and Due From Banks 
Cash and due from banks consist of currency and coin, cash items 

in the process of collection and due from banks. Currency and coin 

includes both U.S. and foreign currency owned and held at Fifth 
Third offices and that is in-transit to the FRB. Cash items in the 
process of collection include checks and drafts that are drawn on 
another depository institution or the FRB that are payable 

immediately upon presentation in the U.S. Balances due from banks 
include non-interest bearing balances that are funds on deposit at 

other depository institutions or the FRB. 
Securities Securities are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or 

trading on the date of purchase. Only those securities which 

management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are 
classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. 
Securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in management™s 
judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, 
changes in market conditions. Securities are classified as trading 

when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in 

the near term. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value 

with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income 

taxes, included in OCI. Trading securities are reported at fair value 
with unrealized gains and losses included in noninterest income. 
The fair value of a security is determined based on quoted market 
prices. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is 
determined based on quoted prices of similar instruments or DCF 

models that incorporate market inputs and assumptions including 

discount rates, prepayment speeds, and loss rates. Realized securities 

gains or losses are reported within noninterest income in the 

Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is 
based on the specific identification method. 
Available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities with 
unrealized losses are reviewed quarterly for possible OTTI. For debt 
securities, if the Bancorp intends to sell the debt security or will 

more likely than not be required to sell the debt security before 

recovery of the entire amortized cost basis, then an OTTI has 
occurred. However, even if the Bancorp does not intend to sell the 
debt security and will not likely be required to sell the debt security 
before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, the Bancorp must 
evaluate expected cash flows to be received and determine if a credit 

loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, the credit 

component of the impairment is recognized within noninterest 

income and the non-credit component is recognized through OCI. 

For equity securities, the Bancorp™s management evaluates the 

securities in an unrealized loss position in the available-for-sale 

portfolio for OTTI on the basis of the duration of the decline in 
value of the security and severity of that decline as well as the 
Bancorp™s intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of 

time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market 

value. If it is determined that the impairment on an equity security is 

other-than-temporary, an impairment loss equal to the difference 

between the amortized cost of the security and its fair value is 
recognized within noninterest income.
Portfolio Loans and Leases  Basis of Accounting Portfolio loans and leases are generally reported at the principal 

amount outstanding, net of unearned income, deferred loan fees 
and costs, and any direct principal charge-offs. Direct loan 
origination fees and costs are deferred and the net amount is 

amortized over the estimated life of the related loans as a yield 
adjustment. Interest income is recognized based on the principal 
balance outstanding computed using the effective interest method. 
Loans acquired by the Bancorp through a purchase business 
combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. 

The Bancorp does not carry over the acquired company™s ALLL, 
nor does the Bancorp add to its exis
ting ALLL as part of purchase 
accounting. Purchased loans are evaluated for evidence of credit 
deterioration at acquisition and recorded at their initial fair value. 
For loans acquired with no evidence of credit deterioration, the fair 

value discount or premium is amortized over the contractual life of 

the loan as an adjustment to yield. For loans acquired with evidence 
of credit deterioration, the Bancorp determines at the acquisition 
date the excess of the loan™s contractually required payments over all 

cash flows expected to be collected as an amount that should not be 

accreted into interest income (nonaccretable difference). The 
remaining amount representing the difference in the expected cash 
flows of acquired loans and the initial investment in the acquired 

loans is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the 
loan or pool of loans (accretable yield). Subsequent to the acqusition 

date, increases in expected cash flows over those expected at the 
acquisition date are recognized prospectively as interest income over 

the remaining life of the loan. The present value of any decreases in 

expected cash flows resulting directly from a change in the 
contractual interest rate are recognized prospectively as a reduction 
of the accretable yield. The present value of any decreases in 

expected cash flows after the acquisition date as a result of credit 
deterioration is recognized by recording an ALLL or a direct charge-
off. Subsequent to the purchase date, the methods utilized to 

estimate the required ALLL are similar to originated loans. Loans 

carried at fair value, mortgage loans held for sale and loans under 

revolving credit agreements are excluded from the scope of this 
guidance on loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality. 
The Bancorp™s lease portfolio consists of both direct financing 
and leveraged leases. Direct financing leases are carried at the 
aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the 
leased property, less unearned income. Interest income on direct 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 91  Fifth Third Bancorp 
financing leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a 
constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding investment. 
Leveraged leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments 
(less nonrecourse debt payments) plus estimated residual value of 

the leased property, less unearned income. Interest income on 

leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the lease to achieve a 
constant rate of return on the outstanding investment in the lease, 
net of the related deferred income tax liability, in the years in which 

the net investment is positive. Nonaccrual Loans and Leases 
When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest, 

amortization of loan premium, accretion of loan discount, and 
amortization/accretion of deferred net loan fees are discontinued 
and all previously accrued and unpaid interest is charged against 
income. Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when 
there is a clear indication that the borrower™s cash flows may not be 

sufficient to meet payments as they become due. Such loans are also 

placed on nonaccrual status when the principal or interest is past 

due 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well secured and in the 
process of collection. The Bancorp classifies residential mortgage 
loans that have principal and interest payments that have become 

past due 150 days as nonaccrual unless the loan is both well secured 
and in the process of collection. Residential mortgage loans may 
stay on nonperforming status for an extended time as the 

foreclosure process typically lasts longer than 180 days. Home 

equity loans and lines of credit are reported on nonaccrual status if 
principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or more unless 
the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Home 

equity loans and lines of credit that have been in default for 60 days 

or more are also reported on nonaccrual status if the senior lien has 
been in default 120 days or more, unless the loan is both well 
secured and in the process of collection. Residential mortgage, 

home equity, automobile and other consumer loans and leases that 

have been modified in a TDR and subsequently become past due 90 
days are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is both well 
secured and in the process of collection. Commercial and credit card 

loans that have been modified in a TDR are classified as nonaccrual 

unless such loans have sustained repayment performance of six 
months or greater and are reasonably assured of repayment in 
accordance with the restructured terms. Well secured loans are 

collateralized by perfected security interests in real and/or personal 
property for which the Bancorp estimates proceeds from sale would 
be sufficient to recover the outstanding principal and accrued 

interest balance of the loan and pay all costs to sell the collateral. 

The Bancorp considers a loan in the process of collection if 

collection efforts or legal action is proceeding and the Bancorp 
expects to collect funds sufficient to bring the loan current or 
recover the entire outstanding principal and accrued interest 
balance. Nonaccrual commercial loans and nonaccrual credit card loans 
are generally accounted for on the cost recovery method. The 

Bancorp believes the cost recovery method is appropriate for 

nonaccrual commercial loans and nonaccrual credit card loans 

because the assessment of collectability of the remaining recorded 
investment of these loans involves a high degree of subjectivity and 
uncertainty due to the nature or absence of underlying collateral. 

Under the cost recovery method, any payments received are applied 
to reduce principal. Once the entire recorded investment is 
collected, additional payments received are treated as recoveries of 

amounts previously charged-off until recovered in full, and any 

subsequent payments are treated as interest income. Nonaccrual 

residential mortgage loans and other nonaccrual consumer loans are 
generally accounted for on the cash basis method. The Bancorp 
believes the cash basis method is appropriate for nonaccrual 
residential mortgage and other nonaccrual consumer loans because 
such loans have generally been written down to estimated collateral 

values and the collectability of the remaining investment involves 

only an assessment of the fair value of the underlying collateral, 

which can be measured more objectively with a lesser degree of 

uncertainty than assessments of typical commercial loan collateral. 
Under the cash basis method, interest income is recognized upon 
cash receipt to the extent to which it would have been accrued on 
the loan™s remaining balance at the contractual rate. Nonaccrual 

loans may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest 

and principal payments become current in accordance with the loan 

agreement and are reasonably assured of repayment in accordance 

with the contractual terms of the loan agreement, or when the loan 
is both well-secured and in the process of collection. 
Commercial loans on nonaccrual status, including those 
modified in a TDR, as well as criticized commercial loans with 

aggregate borrower relationships exceeding $1 million, are subject to 

an individual review to identify charge-offs. The Bancorp does not 

have an established delinquency threshold for partially or fully 

charging off commercial loans. Residential mortgage loans, home 
equity loans and lines of credit and credit card loans that have 
principal and interest payments that have become past due 180 days 
are assessed for a charge-off to the ALLL, unless such loans are 
both well-secured and in the process of collection. Home equity 

loans and lines of credit are also assessed for charge-off to the 

ALLL when such loans or lines of credit have become past due 120 

days if the senior lien is also 120 days past due, unless such loans are 

both well-secured and in the process of collection. Automobile and 

other consumer loans and leases that have principal and interest 

payments that have become past due 120 days are assessed for a 
charge-off to the ALLL, unless such loans are both well-secured and 
in the process of collection.
Restructured Loans and Leases 
A loan is accounted for as a TDR if the Bancorp, for economic or 

legal reasons related to the borrower™s financial difficulties, grants a 
concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. A 
TDR typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction 

of the stated interest rate or remaining principal amount of the loan, 
a reduction of accrued interest, or an extension of the maturity 
date(s) at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for 

a new loan with similar risk. During the third quarter of 2012, the 

OCC, a national bank regulatory agency, issued interpretive 

guidance that requires non-reaffirmed loans included in Chapter 7 
bankruptcy filings to be accounted for as nonperforming TDRs and 
collateral dependent loans regardless of their payment history and 

capacity to pay in the future. The Bancorp™s banking subsidiary is a 
state chartered bank which therefore is not subject to guidance of 
the OCC. The Bancorp does not consider the bankruptcy court™s 

discharge of the borrower™s debt a concession when the discharged 

debt is not reaffirmed, and as such these loans are classified as 
TDRs only if one or more of the previously mentioned concessions 
are granted. The Bancorp measures the impairment loss of a TDR based on 
the difference between the original loan™s carrying amount and the 
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the 
original, effective yield of the loan. Residential mortgage loans, 

home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans 

modified as part of a TDR are maintained on accrual status, 
provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and of 
performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, 

well-documented credit evaluation. Commercial loans and credit 

card loans modified as part of a TDR are maintained on accrual 
status provided there is a sustained payment history of six-months 
or greater prior to the modification in accordance with the modified 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  92  Fifth Third Bancorp 
terms and all remaining contractual payments under the 
modified terms are reasonably assured of collection. TDRs of 

commercial loans and credit cards that do not have a sustained 

payment history of six months or greater in accordance with their 
modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six-month 
payment history is sustained. In certain cases, commercial TDRs on 
nonaccrual status may be accounted for using the cash basis method 

for income recognition, provided that full repayment of principal 

under the modified terms of the loan is reasonably assured.
Impaired Loans and Leases 
A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current 

information and events, it is probable that the Bancorp will be 
unable to collect all amounts due (including both principal and 
interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. 

Impaired loans generally consist of nonaccrual loans and leases, 
loans modified in a TDR and loans over $1 million that are 
currently on accrual status and not yet modified in a TDR, but for 

which the Bancorp has determined that it is probable that it will 

grant a payment concession in the near term due to the borrower™s 

financial difficulties. For loans modified in a TDR, the contractual 
terms of the loan agreement refer to the terms specified in the 
original loan agreement. A loan restructured in a TDR is no longer 

considered impaired in years after the restructuring if the 

restructuring agreement specifies a rate equal to or greater than the 

rate the Bancorp was willing to accept at the time of the 

restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk and the loan is 

not impaired based on the terms specified by the restructuring 

agreement. Refer to the ALLL section for discussion regarding the 
Bancorp™s methodology for identifying impaired loans and 
determination of the need for a loss accrual.
Loans Held for Sale 
Loans held for sale primarily represent conforming fixed-rate 
residential mortgage loans originated or acquired with the intent to 

sell in the secondary market and jumbo residential mortgage loans, 
commercial loans, other residential mortgage loans and other 
consumer loans that management has the intent to sell. Loans held 

for sale may be carried at the lower of cost or fair value, or carried at 

fair value where the Bancorp has elected the fair value option of 

accounting under U.S. GAAP. The Bancorp has elected to measure 
residential mortgage loans originated as held for sale under the fair 
value option. For loans in which the Bancorp has not elected the 

fair value option, the lower of cost or fair value is determined at the 
individual loan level. 
The fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale for 
which the fair value election has been made is estimated based upon 

mortgage-backed securities prices and spreads to those prices or, for 

certain ARM loans, DCF models that may incorporate the 
anticipated portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-backed 
securities with similar collateral, and market conditions. The 
anticipated portfolio composition includes the effects of interest 
rate spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as 

the state in which the loan was originated, the loan amount and the 

ARM margin. These fair value marks are recorded as a component 

of noninterest income in mortgage banking net revenue. The 

Bancorp generally has commitments to sell residential mortgage 
loans held for sale in the secondary market. Gains or losses on sales 
are recognized in mortgage banking net revenue. 
Management™s intent to sell residential mortgage loans 
classified as held for sale may change over time due to such factors 

as changes in the overall liquidity in markets or changes in 

characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. Consequently, 

these loans may be reclassified to loans held for investment and, 

thereafter, reported within the Bancorp™s residential mortgage class 
of portfolio loans and leases. In such cases, the residential mortgage 
loans will continue to be measured at fair value, which is based on 
mortgage-backed securities prices, interest rate risk and an internally 

developed credit component. 
Loans held for sale are placed on nonaccrual status consistent 
with the Bancorp™s nonaccrual policy for portfolio loans and leases. Other Real Estate Owned 
OREO, which is included in other assets, represents property 

acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings and is carried at 
the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. All OREO property 

is periodically evaluated for impairment and decreases in carrying 

value are recognized as reductions in other noninterest income in 

the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
ALLL 
The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into 

portfolio segments for purposes
 of determining the ALLL. The 
Bancorp™s portfolio segments include commercial, residential 
mortgage, and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its 
portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and 
assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. Classes 
within the commercial portfolio segment include commercial and 

industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial 

mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction, and 

commercial leasing. The residential mortgage portfolio segment is 

also considered a class. Classes within the consumer portfolio 
segment include home equity, automobile, credit card, and other 
consumer loans and leases. For an analysis of the Bancorp™s ALLL 
by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to 
Note 6. The Bancorp maintains the ALLL to absorb probable loan and 
lease losses inherent in its portfolio segments. The ALLL is 

maintained at a level the Bancorp considers to be adequate and is 
based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the 
collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. 

Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. 
Provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the Bancorp™s 
review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, 

in management™s judgment, deserve consideration under existing 

economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. The 
Bancorp™s strategy for credit risk management includes a 
combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below 

legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation 

and collections standards. The strategy also emphasizes 
diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular 
credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large 

credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit 

quality. 
The Bancorp™s methodology for determining the ALLL is 
based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific 

allocation on loans modified in a TDR and impaired commercial 

credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. 
Allowances on individual commercial loans, TDRs and historical 
loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on 

changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual 

collection and charge-off experience. An unallocated allowance is 
maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and 
measuring losses when evaluating allowances for individual loans or 

pools of loans. 
Larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower 
relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or 
observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been 

modified in a TDR, are subject to individual review for impairment. 
The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality 
of any guarantees, the guarantor™s liquidity and willingness to 

cooperate, the loan structure, and other factors when evaluating 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 93  Fifth Third Bancorp 
whether an individual loan is impaired. Other factors may include 
the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and 

financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the 

borrower, and the Bancorp™s evaluation of the borrower™s 

management. When individual loans are impaired, allowances are 

determined based on management™s estimate of the borrower™s 
ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other 
sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options 

available to the Bancorp. Allowances for impaired loans are 

measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows 

discounted at the loan™s effective interest rate, fair value of the 

underlying collateral or readily observable secondary market values. 

The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and 

interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. 
Historical credit loss rates are applied to commercial loans that 
are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established 

threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance 

allocations. The loss rates are derived from a migration analysis, 

which tracks the historical net charge-off experience sustained on 
loans according to their internal risk grade. The risk grading system 
utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten categories. 
Homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and 
consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded. 
Rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring 

are used to assess credit risks, and allowances are established based 

on the expected net charge-offs. Loss rates are based on the trailing 

twelve month net charge-off history by loan category. Historical loss 

rates may be adjusted for certain prescriptive and qualitative factors 

that, in management™s judgment, are necessary to reflect losses 

inherent in the portfolio. Factors that management considers in the 
analysis include the effects of the national and local economies; 
trends in the nature and volume of delinquencies, charge-offs and 

nonaccrual loans; changes in loan mix; credit score migration 
comparisons; asset quality trends; risk management and loan 
administration; changes in the internal lending policies and credit 

standards; collection practices; and examination results from bank 

regulatory agencies and the Bancorp™s internal credit reviewers. 
The Bancorp™s primary market areas for lending are the 
Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the Unites States. When 
evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to 

these regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated 

effect changing economic conditions have on the Bancorp™s 

customers. In the current year, the Bancorp has not substantively changed 
any material aspect to its overall approach to determining its ALLL 

for any of its portfolio segments. There have been no material 
changes in criteria or estimation techniques as compared to prior 
periods that impacted the determination of the current period 
ALLL for any of the Bancorp™s portfolio segments. 
Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 
The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level 
believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated 

probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included 

in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 
determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an 
evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment 

of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading 
and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. This 
process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are 

analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the Bancorp™s 

ALLL, as discussed above. Net adjustments to the reserve for 

unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense 

in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Loan Sales and Securitizations 
The Bancorp periodically sells loans through either securitizations 

or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies. 

The sold loans are removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or 

loss is recognized in the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial 

Statements at the time of sale. The Bancorp typically isolates the 

loans through the use of a VIE and thus is required to assess 

whether the entity holding the sold or securitized loans is a VIE and 

whether the Bancorp is the primary beneficiary and therefore 
consolidator of that VIE. If the Bancorp holds the power to direct 
activities most significant to the economic performance of the VIE 

and has the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits 
that could potentially be significant to the VIE, then the Bancorp 
will generally be deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. If the 

Bancorp is determined not to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE 

but holds a variable interest in the entity, such variable interests are 

accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other 
accounting standards as appropriate. Refer to Note 10 for further 
information on consolidated and non-consolidated VIEs. 
The Bancorp™s loan sales and securitizations are generally 
structured with servicing retained. As a result, servicing rights 

resulting from residential mortgage loan sales are initially recorded 

at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to and over 

the period of estimated net servicing revenues and are reported as a 

component of mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated 
Statements of Income. Servicing rights are assessed for impairment 
monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment 
recognized through a valuation allowance and permanent 

impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset 

and related valuation allowance. Key economic assumptions used in 

measuring any potential impairment of the servicing rights include 

the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-
average life, the discount rate, and the weighted-average coupon, as 
applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the 
servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic 
assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. The Bancorp 

monitors risk and adjusts its valuation allowance as necessary to 

adequately reserve for impairment in the servicing portfolio. For 

purposes of measuring impairment, the mortgage servicing rights 

are stratified into classes based on the financial asset type (fixed-rate 

vs. adjustable rate) and interest rates. Fees received for servicing 
loans owned by investors are based on a percentage of the 
outstanding monthly principal balance of such loans and are 

included in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of 

Income as loan payments are received. Costs of servicing loans are 

charged to expense as incurred.
Reserve for Representation and Warranty Provisions 
Conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third 

parties are generally sold with representation and warranty 

provisions. A contractual liability arises only in the event of a breach 

of these representations and warranties and, in general, only when a 

loss results from the breach. The Bancorp may be required to 
repurchase any previously sold loan or indemnify (make whole) the 
investor or insurer for which the representation or warranty of the 
Bancorp proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. The 

Bancorp establishes a residential mortgage repurchase reserve 

related to various representations and warranties that reflects 

management™s estimate of losses based on a combination of factors. 
The Bancorp™s estimation process requires management to 
make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain, such as future demand expectations, economic 
factors and the specific characteristics of the loans subject to 
repurchase. Such factors incorporate historical investor audit and 

repurchase demand rates, appeals success rates, historical loss 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  94  Fifth Third Bancorp 
severity, and any additional information obtained from the GSEs 
regarding future mortgage repurchase and file request criteria. At the 

time of a loan sale, the Bancorp records a representation and 

warranty reserve at the estimated fair value of the Bancorp™s 
guarantee and continually updates the reserve during the life of the 
loan as losses in excess of the reserve become probable and 
reasonably estimable. The provision for the estimated fair value of 

the representation and warranty guarantee arising from the loan 

sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale, which is 

included in other noninterest income at the time of sale. Updates to 

the reserve are recorded in other noninterest expense. 
 Legal Contingencies The Bancorp is party to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as 
threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising 
from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of claims 
or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently 

difficult to predict, and significant judgment may be required in the 
determination of both the probability of loss and whether the 
amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The Bancorp™s estimates 

are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory 

proceedings, the merit of the Bancorp™s defenses and consultation 

with internal and external legal counsel. A reserve for a potential 
litigation loss is established when information related to the loss 
contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the 
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. This reserve is included 
in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is 

adjusted from time to time as appropriate to reflect changes in 

circumstances. Legal expenses are recorded in other noninterest 

expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Bank Premises and Equipment 
Bank premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, 
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. 
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on 

estimated useful lives of the assets for book purposes, while 

accelerated depreciation is used for income tax purposes. 
Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the 
straight-line method over the lives of the related leases or useful 

lives of the related assets, whichever is shorter. Whenever events or 

changes in circumstances dictate, the Bancorp tests its long-lived 
assets for impairment by determining whether the sum of the 
estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to a long-lived 

asset or asset group is less than the carrying amount of the long-

lived asset or asset group through a probability-weighted 

approach. In the event the carrying amount of the long-lived asset 

or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is measured as 

the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or 

asset group exceeds its fair value. Maintenance, repairs and minor 
improvements are charged to noninterest expense in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income as incurred. 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Bancorp accounts for its derivatives as either assets or liabilities 

measured at fair value through adjustments to AOCI and/or current 

earnings, as appropriate. On the date the Bancorp enters into a 

derivative contract, the Bancorp designates the derivative 

instrument as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or as a free-
standing derivative instrument. For a fair value hedge, changes in 
the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair 
value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk 

are recorded in current period net income. For a cash flow hedge, 

changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument, to the extent 

that it is effective, are recorded in AOCI and subsequently 

reclassified to net income in the same period(s) that the hedged 
transaction impacts net income. For free-standing derivative 
instruments, changes in fair values are reported in current period net 
income. Prior to entering into a hedge transaction, the Bancorp 
formally documents the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management 

objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This 

process includes linking the derivative instrument designated as a 

fair value or cash flow hedge to a specific asset or liability on the 
balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and the risk 
being hedged, along with a formal assessment at both inception of 

the hedge and on an ongoing basis as to the effectiveness of the 
derivative instrument in offsetting changes in fair values or cash 
flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the derivative 

instrument is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is 

discontinued.  Income Taxes The Bancorp estimates income tax expense based on amounts 

expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which the 

Bancorp conducts business. On a quarterly basis, management 

assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its 

current estimate of the amount and components of net income, tax 
credits and the applicable statutory tax rates expected for the full 
year. The estimated income tax expense is recorded in the 

Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using 
the balance sheet method and the net deferred tax asset or liability is 

reported in other assets or accrued taxes, interest and expenses in 

the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under this method, the net 

deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the 
differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, 
and reflects enacted changes in tax rates and laws. Deferred tax 

assets are recognized to the extent they exist and are subject to a 

valuation allowance based on management™s judgment that 

realization is more likely than not. This analysis is performed on a 
quarterly basis and includes an evaluation of all positive and 
negative evidence, such as the limitation on the use of any net 

operating losses, to determine whether realization is more likely 
than not. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to 
taxing jurisdictions and are reported in accrued taxes, interest and 

expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp 
evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax 
treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering 

statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information and 

maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these relative 
risks and merits. Changes to the estimate of accrued taxes occur 
periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, 

the status of examinations being conducted by taxing authorities 

and changes to statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that 

impact the relative risks of tax positions. These changes, when they 

occur, can affect deferred taxes and accrued taxes as well as the 

current period™s income tax expense and can be significant to the 

operating results of the Bancorp. Any interest and penalties incurred 
in connection with income taxes are recorded as a component of 
income tax expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 

additional information on income taxes, refer to Note 20.
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income 

available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number 

of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Earnings 

per diluted share is computed by dividing adjusted net income 
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 95  Fifth Third Bancorp 
of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents 
outstanding during the period. Dilutive common stock equivalents 

represent the assumed conversion of dilutive convertible preferred 

stock, the exercise of dilutive stock-based awards and warrants and 

the dilutive effect of the settlement of outstanding forward 

contracts. 
The Bancorp calculates earnings per share pursuant to the two-
class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation 

formula that determines earnings per share separately for common 

stock and participating securities according to dividends declared 

and participation rights in undistributed earnings. For purposes of 

calculating earnings per share under the two-class method, restricted 

shares that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are considered 

participating securities until vested. While the dividends declared per 
share on such restricted shares are the same as dividends declared 
per common share outstanding, the dividends recognized on such 

restricted shares may be less because dividends paid on restricted 

shares that are expected to be forfeited are reclassified to 

compensation expense during the period when forfeiture is 
expected.  Goodwill 
Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include 
the acquisition of goodwill. Goodwill is required to be tested for 

impairment at the Bancorp™s reporting unit level on an annual basis, 
which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more frequently if 
events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. The 
Bancorp has determined that its segments qualify as reporting units 
under U.S. GAAP. 
Impairment exists when a reporting unit™s carrying amount of 
goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. In testing goodwill for 

impairment, U.S. GAAP permits the Bancorp to first assess 

qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not 
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. 
In this qualitative assessment, the Bancorp evaluates events and 
circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general 

economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, 

the overall financial performance of the Bancorp, the performance 

of the Bancorp™s common stock, the key financial performance 

metrics of the Bancorp™s reporting units, and events affecting the 
reporting units. If, after assessing the totality of events and 
circumstances, the Bancorp determines it is not more likely than not 
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, 
then performing the two-step impairment test would be 

unnecessary. However, if the Bancorp concludes otherwise, it would 

then be required to perform the first step (Step 1) of the goodwill 

impairment test, and continue to the second step (Step 2), if 

necessary. Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair 
value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including 
goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its 
fair value, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is performed to 
measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be 
received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between 

market participants at the measurement date. As none of the 

Bancorp™s reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting 

unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the 

Bancorp™s stock price. To determine the fair value of a reporting 
unit, the Bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the 
reporting unit™s forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value 

approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the 

forecast) and the reporting unit™s estimated cost of equity as the 

discount rate. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market 
capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the 
Bancorp™s stock during the month including the measurement date, 
incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this 

market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of 

the Bancorp™s reporting units in order to corroborate the results of 

the income approach. 
When required to perform Step 2, the Bancorp compares the 
implied fair value of a reporting unit™s goodwill with the carrying 
amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied 
fair value, an impairment loss equal to that excess amount is 
recognized. A recognized impairment loss cannot exceed the 

carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed in future 

periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently 

recovers. During Step 2, the Bancorp determines the implied fair value 
of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the 
reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including 
any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been 

acquired in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of 

the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and 

liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This assignment 

process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for 
impairment. The Bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of 
recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if appropriate), 
nor does it recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets in 

the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of this assignment 

process. Refer to Note 8 for further information regarding the 

Bancorp™s goodwill.
Fair Value Measurements The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair 

value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the 
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the 

measurement date. Valuation techniques the Bancorp uses to 
measure fair value include the market approach, income approach 
and cost approach. The market approach uses prices or relevant 

information generated by market transactions involving identical or 

comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves 

discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based 
on current market expectations about those future amounts. The 
cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be 
required to replace the service capacity of the asset. 
U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes 
the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into 

three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority 

to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

(Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A 
financial instrument™s categorization within the fair value hierarchy 
is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the 
instrument™s fair value measurement. The three levels within the fair 
value hierarchy are described as follows: 
Level 1 Œ Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities that the Bancorp has the ability 
to access at the measurement date. 
Level 2 Œ Inputs other than quoted prices included within 
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 

directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: quoted prices 

for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted 
prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets 
that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are 

observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  96  Fifth Third Bancorp 
derived principally from or corroborated by observable 
market data by correlation or other means. 
Level 3 Œ Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for 
which there is little, if any, market activity at the 
measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect the 

Bancorp™s own assumptions about what market participants 

would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are 
developed based on the best information available in the 

circumstances, which might include the Bancorp™s own 

financial data such as internally developed pricing models 
and DCF methodologies, as well as instruments for which 
the fair value determination requires significant management 

judgment.  The Bancorp™s fair value measurements involve various 
valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are 

observable, when available. Valuation techniques and parameters 

used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated 
by the Bancorp on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Bancorp 
monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a 

variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and 

exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to 
previous trades and overall review and assessments for 
reasonableness. Refer to Note 27 for further information on fair 

value measurements.
  Stock-Based Compensation 
The Bancorp recognizes compensation expense for the grant-date 

fair value of stock-based awards that are expected to vest over the 

requisite service period. All awards, both those with cliff vesting and 
graded vesting, are expensed on a straight-line basis. Awards to 
employees that meet eligible retirement status are expensed 
immediately. As compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax 
asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax 

deduction from exercise or release of restrictions. At the time 

awards are exercised, cancelled, expire, or restrictions are released, 

the Bancorp may be required to recognize an adjustment to income 

tax expense for the difference between the previously estimated tax 
deduction and the actual tax deduction realized. For further 
information on the Bancorp™s stock-based compensation plans, 
refer to Note 24.Pension Plans The Bancorp uses an expected long-term rate of return applied to 

the fair market value of assets as of the beginning of the year and 

the expected cash flow during the year for calculating the expected 

investment return on all pension plan assets. Amortization of the 
net gain or loss resulting from experience different from that 
assumed and from changes in assumptions (excluding asset gains 
and losses not yet reflected in market-related value) is included as a 
component of net periodic benefit cost. If, as of the beginning of 

the year, that net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the 

projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan 

assets, the amortization is that excess divided by the average 

remaining service period of participating employees expected to 
receive benefits under the plan. The Bancorp uses a third-party 
actuary to compute the remaining service period of participating 

employees. This period reflects expected turnover, pre-retirement 

mortality, and other applicable employee demographics. 
Other Securities and other property held by Fifth Third Investment 

Advisors, a division of the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary, in a 

fiduciary or agency capacity are not included in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets because such items are not assets of the subsidiaries. 
Investment advisory revenue in the Consolidated Statements of 

Income is recognized on the accrual basis. Investment advisory 

service revenues are recognized monthly based on a fee charged per 
transaction processed and/or a fee charged on the market value of 
average account balances associated with individual contracts. 
The Bancorp recognizes revenue from its card and processing 
services on an accrual basis as such services are performed, 

recording revenues net of certain costs (primarily interchange fees 

charged by credit card associations) not controlled by the Bancorp. 
The Bancorp purchases life insurance policies on the lives of 
certain directors, officers and employees and is the owner and 
beneficiary of the policies. The Bancorp invests in these policies, 
known as BOLI, to provide an efficient form of funding for long-

term retirement and other employee benefits costs. The Bancorp 

records these BOLI policies within other assets in the Consolidated 

Balance Sheets at each policy™s respective cash surrender value, with 
changes recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated 

Statements of Income. 
Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles, 
customer lists, non-compete agreements and cardholder 
relationships. Other intangible assets are amortized on either a 

straight-line or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. 

The Bancorp reviews other intangible assets for impairment 

whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying 

amounts may not be recoverable. 
Securities sold under repurchase agreements are accounted for 
as secured borrowings and included in other short-term borrowings 
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amounts at which the 
securities were sold plus accrued interest. Acquisitions of treasury stock are carried at cost. Reissuance of 
shares in treasury for acquisitions, exercises of stock-based awards 
or other corporate purposes is recorded based on the specific 
identification method. Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred. 
Accounting and Reporting Developments 
 Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements for 
Which the Total Amount of the Obligation is Fixed at the Reporting Date 

In February 2013, the FASB issued amended guidance relating to 

the measurement of obligations resulting from joint and several 
liability arrangements for which the total amount under the 
arrangement is fixed at the reporting date. For the total amount of 

an obligation under an arrangement to be considered fixed at the 

reporting date, there can be no measurement uncertainty relating to 
the total amount of the obligation. The obligation resulting from 
joint and several liability arrangements would be measured initially 

as the sum of 1) the amount the Bancorp has agreed to pay on the 

basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and 2) any additional 

amount the Bancorp expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. 

The amended guidance also would require the Bancorp to disclose 

the nature and amount of the obligation as well as information 

about the risks that such obligations pose to future cash flows. The 
amended guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning 
after December 15, 2013 and was applied retrospectively to all prior 

periods presented for those obligations resulting from joint and 

several liability arrangements that exist at the beginning of the fiscal 
year of adoption. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance on 
January 1, 2014 and the adoption did not have a material impact on 

the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss 
Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists 

In July 2013, the FASB issued amended guidance to clarify that an 

unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax 

benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a 

reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss 
carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except 
as follows. To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar 

tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting 

date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any 

income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax 

position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require 

the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred 

tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be 
presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be 
combined with deferred tax assets. The assessment of whether a 

deferred tax asset is available is based on the unrecognized tax 

benefit and deferred tax asset that exist at the reporting date and 

should be made presuming disallowance of the tax position at the 
reporting date. The amended guidance was effective for fiscal years, 
and interim periods within those years, beginning after 

December 15, 2013, with early adoption permitted. The Bancorp 
adopted the amended guidance on January 1, 2014 and the adoption 
of the amended guidance did not have a material impact on the 

Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects 

In January 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance which would 

permit the Bancorp to make an accounting policy election to 

account for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects 
using a proportional amortization method if certain conditions are 
met and to present the amortization as a component of income tax 

expense. The amended guidance would be applied retrospectively to 
all periods presented and is effective for fiscal years, and interim 
periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014, with 

early adoption permitted. Regardless of the policy election, the 

amended guidance requires disclosures to enable the users of the 

financial statements to understand the nature of the Bancorp™s 
investments in qualified affordable housing projects and the effect 
of the measurement of the investments in qualified affordable 

housing projects and the related tax credits on the Bancorp™s 

financial position and results of operation. 
The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance on January 1, 
2015, and did not make an accounting policy election to apply the 

proportional amortization method for its investments in qualified 

affordable housing projects. Therefore, the adoption did not have 
an impact on the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage 
Loans upon Foreclosure 
In January 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance that clarifies 

when a creditor should be considered to have received physical 

possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a 

consumer mortgage loan such that the loan receivable should be 
derecognized and the real estate property recognized. The amended 
guidance clarifies that an in substance repossession or foreclosure 
occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical 
possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a 

consumer mortgage loan, upon either (1) the creditor obtaining legal 

title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a 

foreclosure or (2) the borrower conveying all interest in the 

residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan 
through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a 
similar legal agreement. In addition, the amended guidance requires 
interim and annual disclosures of both (1) the amount of foreclosed 
residential real estate property held by the creditor and (2) the 

recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by 

residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure 

according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction. The 

amended guidance may be applied prospectively or through a 
modified retrospective approach and is effective for fiscal years, and 
interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 
2014, with early adoption permitted. The Bancorp adopted the 

amended guidance on January 1, 2015 and the adoption of the 

amended guidance did not have a material impact on the Bancorp™s 

Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of 
Components of an Entity 
In April 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance that changes the 

criteria for reporting discontinued operations. The amended 

guidance requires a disposal of a component of an entity or a group 

of components of an entity to be reported in discontinued 

operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will 
have) a major effect on an entity™s operations and financial results 
when any of the following occurs: 1) the component of an entity or 
group of components of an entity meets the criteria to be classified 
as held for sale; 2) the component of an entity or group of 

components of an entity is disposed of by sale; or 3) the component 

of an entity or group of components of an entity is disposed of 

other than by sale (for example, by abandonment or in a distribution 

to owners in a spinoff). The amended guidance requires an entity to 

present, for each comparative period, the assets and liabilities of a 

disposal group that includes a discontinued operation separately in 
the asset and liability sections, respectively, of the statement of 
financial position, as well as additional disclosures about 

discontinued operations. The amended guidance is to be applied 

prospectively for 1) all disposals (or classifications as held for sale) 

of components of an entity that occur within annual periods 
beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods 
within those years; and 2) all businesses or nonprofit activities that, 

on acquisition, are classified as held for sale that occur within annual 
periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim 
periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted, but only for 

disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been 

reported in financial statements previously issued. The Bancorp 
adopted the amended guidance on January 1, 2015 and the adoption 
of the amended guidance did not have a material impact on the 

Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements.  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
In May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance on revenue 

recognition from contracts with customers. The standard outlines a 

single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for 

revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most 

contract revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific 

guidance. The core principle of the amended guidance is that an 

entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised 
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange 

for those goods or services. The amended guidance is effective for 

annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and 
interim periods within the reporting period, and should be applied 
either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or 

retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the 

amendments recognized at the date of initial application. Early 
adoption is prohibited. The Bancorp is currently in the process of

 Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures 
In June 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance that changes the 
accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions to secured 
borrowing accounting. The amended guidance also requires separate 

accounting for a transfer of a financial asset executed 

contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same 

counterparty, which will result in secured borrowing accounting for 

the repurchase agreement. The amended guidance requires 

disclosures for certain transactions comprising: 1) a transfer of a 
financial asset accounted for as a sale and 2) an agreement with the 
same transferee entered into in contemplation of the initial transfer 
that results in the transferor retaining substantially all of the 

exposure to the economic return on the transferred financial asset 

throughout the term of the transaction. The amended guidance also 

requires new disclosures for repurchase agreements, securities 
lending transactions, and repurchase-to-maturity transactions 
accounted for as secured borrowings. The amended guidance is 
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, 
beginning after December 15, 2014, with early adoption prohibited. 

Changes in accounting for transactions outstanding on the effective 

date should be presented as a cumulative-effect adjustment to 

retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The 

disclosures for certain transactions accounted for as a sale are 
required to be presented for interim and annual periods beginning 
after December 15, 2014, and the disclosures for repurchase 
agreements, securities lending transactions, and repurchase-to-
maturity transactions accounted for as secured borrowings are 

required to be presented for annual periods beginning after 

December 15, 2014, and interim periods beginning after March 15, 

2015. The Bancorp adopted the amended guidance on January 1, 
2015 and the adoption of the amended guidance did not have a 
material impact on the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial 

Statements.  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of the Award Provide 

That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service 

Period In June 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance which clarifies 
that a performance target that affects vesting and can be achieved 

after the requisite service period be treated as a performance 

condition. The amended guidance provides that an entity should 
apply existing guidance as it relates to awards with performance 
conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. As such, 

the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the 

grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be 

recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the 

performance target will be achieved and should represent the 

compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the 

requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance 
target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the 
requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation 

cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite 

service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized 
during and after the requisite service period should reflect the 
number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted 

to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service 

period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still 
be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. 
The amended guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim 

periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 

2015, with early adoption permitted. The amended guidance may be 
adopted either prospectively to all awards granted or modified after 
the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance 
targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual 

period presented in the financial statements and to all new or 

modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted, 
the cumulative effect of applying the amended guidance as of the 
beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial 

statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening 
retained earnings balance at that date. The amended guidance is not 
expected to have a material impact on the Bancorp™s Consolidated 

Financial Statements. 
 Measuring the Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated 
Collateralized Financing Entity 
In August 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance that provides 

an alternative to ASC Topic 820: Fair Value Measurement for 

measuring the financial assets and financial liabilities of a CFE, such 

as a collateralized debt obligation or a collateralized loan obligation 

entity consolidated as a VIE when a) all of the financial assets and 

the financial liabilities of that CFE are measured at fair value in the 

consolidated financial statements and b) the changes in the fair 
values of those financial assets and financial liabilities are reflected 
in earnings. If elected, the measurement alternative would allow the 
Bancorp to measure both the financial assets and the financial 
liabilities of the CFE by using the more observable of the fair value 

of the financial assets or the fair value of the financial liabilities and 

to eliminate any measurement difference. When the measurement 

alternative is not elected for a consolidated CFE within the scope of 
this amended guidance, the amendments clarify that 1) the fair value 
of the financial assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities of 
the consolidated CFE should be measured using the requirements 
of Topic 820 and 2) any difference in the fair value of the financial 

assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities of that 

consolidated CFE should be reflected in earnings and attributed to 

the Bancorp in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The 

amended guidance may be applied retrospectively or through a 
modified retrospective approach and is effective for fiscal years, and 
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after 
December 15, 2015. The amended guidance is not expected to have 

a material impact on the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial 

Statements.  Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans upon 
Foreclosure In August 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance clarifying the 
classification of certain foreclosed mortgage loans that are either full 
or partially guaranteed under government programs. The amended 

guidance requires that a mortgage loan be derecognized and that a 

separate other receivable be recognized upon foreclosure if the 

following conditions are met: 1) the loan has a government 

guarantee that is not separable from the loan before foreclosure; 2) 
at the time of foreclosure, the creditor has the intent to convey the 
real estate property to the guarantor and make a claim on the 
guarantee, and the creditor has the ability to recover under that 
claim; and 3) at the time of foreclosure, any amount of the claim 

that is determined on the basis of the fair value of the real estate is 

fixed. Upon foreclosure, the separate other receivable would be 

measured based on the amount of the loan balance (principal and 
interest) expected to be recovered from the guarantor. The 
amended guidance may be applied prospectively or through a 
modified retrospective approach and is effective for fiscal years, and 
interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 
2014, with early adoption permitted. The Bancorp adopted the 

amended guidance on January 1, 2015 and the adoption of the 
amended guidance did not have a material impact on the Bancorp™s 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pushdown Accounting In November 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance on whether 

and at what threshold an acquired entity that is a business or 

nonprofit activity can apply pushdown accounting in its separate 

financial statements upon the occurrence of an event in which an 

acquirer (an individual or an entity) obtains control of the acquired 
entity. The amended guidance provides that an acquired entity may 
elect the option to apply pushdown accounting in the reporting 

period in which the change-in-control event occurs. An acquired 

entity should determine whether to elect to apply pushdown 

accounting for each individual change-in-control event in which an 

acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. If pushdown 

accounting is not applied in the reporting period in which the 

change-in-control event occurs, an acquired entity will have the 
option to elect to apply pushdown accounting in a subsequent 
reporting period to the acquired entity™s most recent change-in-

control event. An election to apply pushdown accounting in a 

reporting period after the reporting period in which the change-in-

control event occurred should be considered a change in accounting 
principle. If pushdown accounting is applied to an individual 
change-in-control event, that election is irrevocable. If an acquired 

entity elects the option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate 
financial statements, it should disclose information in the current 
reporting period that enables users of financial statements to 

evaluate the effect of pushdown accounting. The amended guidance 

was effective upon issuance, and the adoption of the amended 

guidance did not have a material impact on the Bancorp™s 

Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument 
Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to Debt or Equity 
In November 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance that 

clarifies how current GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the 
economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid 
financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. 

Specifically, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider 

all relevant terms and featuresŠincluding the embedded derivative 

features being evaluated for bifurcationŠin evaluating the nature of 
the host contract. Furthermore, the amendments clarify that no 
single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic 

characteristics and risks of the host contract. Rather, the nature of 

the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and 

risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. The amended 

guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within 

those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early 

adoption permitted. The effects of initially adopting the amended 
guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to 
existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as 
of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are 
effective and shall be reported as a cumulative-effect adjustment 

directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of 

adoption. The amended guidance is not expected to have a material 

impact on the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of 
Extraordinary Items 
In January 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that eliminates 
the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP. Presently, an event 

or transaction is presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of a 

reporting entity unless evidence clearly supports its classification as 

an extraordinary item, which must be both unusual in nature and 

infrequent in occurrence. An entity was required to segregate the 
extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show 
the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income 
from continuing operations. An entity was also required to disclose 
applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earnings-per-

share data applicable to the extraordinary item. The presentation 

and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur 

infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items 

that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. The 
amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods 
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with 
early adoption permitted provided that the guidance is applied from 

the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amended guidance 

may be applied prospectively or retrospectively to all periods 

presented in the financial statements. The amended guidance is not 

expected to have a material impact on the Bancorp™s Consolidated 
Financial Statements 
Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis 
In February 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that changes 

the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it 
should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The amended 
guidance 1) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships 

and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities; 2) 

eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate 

a limited partnership; 3) affects the consolidation analysis of 
reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that 
have fee arrangements and related party relationships; and 4) 

provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for 
reporting entities that are required to comply with or operate in 
accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 

of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money 

market funds. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, 

and interim periods within those years, beginning after 
December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The amended 
guidance may be applied using either a retrospective approach or a 
modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect 

adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of 
adoption. The Bancorp is currently in the process of evaluating the 

impact of adopting the amended guidance on the Bancorp™s 

Consolidated Financial Statements..

3. RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND DIVIDENDS 
The FRB, under Regulation D, requires that banks hold cash in 
reserve against deposit liabilities, known as the reserve requirement.  
The reserve requirement is calculated based on a two-week average 

of daily net transaction account deposits as defined by the FRB and 

may be satisfied with vault cash. When vault cash is not sufficient to 
meet the reserve requirement, the remaining amount must be 
satisfied with funds held at the FRB. At December 31, 2014 and 

2013, the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary reserve requirement was 

$1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. Vault cash was not 
sufficient to meet the total reserve requirement; therefore, as of 
December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary 

satisfied the remaining reserve requirement with $1.0 billion and 
$942 million, respectively, of the Bancorp™s total deposit at the FRB. 

The noninterest-bearing portion of the Bancorp™s deposit at the 
FRB is held in cash and due from banks in the Consolidated 

Balance Sheets while the interest bearing portion is held in other 

short-term investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The dividends paid by the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary are 
subject to regulations and limitations prescribed by state and federal 

supervisory agencies. The Bancorp™s banking subsidiary paid the 
Bancorp™s nonbank subsidiary holding company, which in turn paid 
the Bancorp $1.1 billion and $859 million in dividends during the 

years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

 In 2011, the FRB adopted the capital plan rule, which requires 

BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit 
annual capital plans to the FRB for review.  Under the rule, these 
capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the 
BHC™s internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies 
governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, 

dividends, and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions 

over a nine-quarter planning horizon.  Further, each BHC must also 

report to the FRB the results of stress tests conducted by the BHC 

under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of 
capital under baseline and stressed economic scenarios.  The FRB 
launched the 2014 stress testing program and CCAR on November 
1, 2013, with firm submissions of stress test results and capital plans 
due to the FRB on January 6, 2014, which the Bancorp submitted as 

required. 
The FRB™s review of the capital plan assessed the 
comprehensiveness of the capital plan, the reasonableness of the 

assumptions and the analysis underlying the capital plan. 
Additionally, the FRB reviewed the robustness of the capital 
adequacy process, the capital policy and the Bancorp™s ability to 

maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and 

above a Tier I common ratio of five percent on a pro forma basis 

under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning 

horizon. The FRB assessed the Bancorp™s strategies for addressing 
proposed revisions to the regulatory capital framework agreed upon 
by the BCBS and requirements arising from the DFA.  
On March 26, 2014, the FRB announced it had completed the 
2014 CCAR. For BHCs that proposed capital distributions in their 

plans, the FRB either objected to the plan or provided a non-

objection whereby the FRB permitted the proposed 2014 capital 
distributions. The FRB indicated to the Bancorp that it did not 
object to the following proposed capital actions for the period 

beginning April 1, 2014 and ending March 31, 2015: 
(a)The potential increase in the quarterly common stock 
dividend to $0.13 per share;  
(b)The potential repurchase of common shares in an amount 
up to $669 million;  
(c)The additional ability to repurchase shares in the amount 
of any after-tax gains from the sale of Vantiv, Inc. 
common stock; and 
(d)The issuance of $300 million in preferred stock. 
As contemplated by the 2014 CCAR, during the second quarter 
of 2014, the Bancorp increased the quarterly common stock 
dividend from $0.12 to $0.13 per share, entered into a $150 million 
accelerated share repurchase transaction, and issued 300,000 
depositary shares of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock for 
net proceeds of $297 million. Additionally, during the third and 

fourth quarters of 2014, the Bancorp entered into accelerated share 

repurchase transactions of $225 million and $180 million, 

respectively. Additionally, as a CCAR institution, the Bancorp is required to 
disclose the results of its company-run stress test under the 
supervisory severely adverse scenario, and to provide information 
related to the types of risk included in its stress testing; a general 
description of the methodologies used; estimates of certain financial 

results and pro forma capital ratios; and an explanation of the most 

significant causes of changes in regulatory capital ratios. On March 

26, 2014 the Bancorp publicly disclosed the results of its company-

run stress test as required by the DFA stress testing rules. 
The BHCs that participated in the 2014 CCAR, including the 
Bancorp, are required to conduct mid-cycle company-run stress 
tests using data as of March 31, 2014. The stress tests must be based 
on three BHC defined scenarios Œ baseline, adverse and severely 

adverse. As required, the Bancorp reported the mid-cycle stress test 

results to the FRB on July 7, 2014. These results represented 

estimates of the Bancorp™s results from the second quarter of 2014 
through the second quarter of 2016 under the severely adverse 
scenario, which is considered highly unlikely to occur.

The FRB launched the 2015 stress testing program and CCAR 
on October 23, 2014. The stress testing results and capital plan were

The FRB expects to release summary results of the 2015 stress

A CREDIT RISK PROFILE 
Commercial Portfolio Segment 
For purposes of monitoring the credit quality and risk 
characteristics of its commercial portfolio segment, the Bancorp 
disaggregates the segment into the following classes: commercial 
and industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial 

mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction and 
commercial leasing.  
To facilitate the monitoring of credit quality within the 
commercial portfolio segment, and for purposes of analyzing 

historical loss rates used in the determination of the ALLL for the 

commercial portfolio segment, the Bancorp utilizes the following 
categories of credit grades: pass, special mention, substandard, 
doubtful or loss. The five categories, which are derived from 

standard regulatory rating definitions, are assigned upon initial 
approval of credit to borrowers and updated periodically thereafter.  
Pass ratings, which are assigned to those borrowers that do not 
have identified potential or well defined weaknesses and for which 

there is a high likelihood of orderly repayment, are updated at least 

annually based on the size and credit characteristics of the borrower. 
All other categories are updated on a quarterly basis during the 
month preceding the end of the calendar quarter.  
The Bancorp assigns a special mention rating to loans and 
leases that have potential weaknesses that deserve management™s 

close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, 

at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment 
prospects for the loan or lease or the Bancorp™s credit position.  
The Bancorp assigns a substandard rating to loans and leases 
that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and 

paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged. 
Substandard loans and leases have well defined weaknesses or 
weaknesses that could jeopardize the orderly repayment of the debt. 

Loans and leases in this grade also are characterized by the distinct 

possibility that the Bancorp will sustain some loss if the deficiencies 

noted are not addressed and corrected. 
The Bancorp assigns a doubtful rating to loans and leases that 
have all the attributes of a substandard rating with the added 

characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in 
full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, 
highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is 

extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonable 

specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and 
strengthen the credit quality of the loan or lease, its classification as 
an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be 

determined. Pending factors may include a proposed merger or 

acquisition, liquidation proceeding, capital injection, perfecting liens 
on additional collateral or refinancing plans. Loans and leases classified as loss are considered uncollectible 
and are charged-off in the period in which they are determined to be 

uncollectible. Because loans and leases in this category are fully 
charged-off, they are not included in the following tables.

     Consumer Portfolio Segment 
For purposes of monitoring the credit quality and risk 
characteristics of its consumer portfolio segment, the Bancorp 
disaggregates the segment into the following classes: home equity, 
automobile loans, credit card, and other consumer loans and leases. 

The Bancorp™s residential mortgage portfolio segment is also a 
separate class. The Bancorp considers repayment performance as the best 
indicator of credit quality for residential mortgage and consumer 
loans, which includes both the delinquency status and performing 
versus nonperforming status of the loans. The delinquency status of 

all residential mortgage and consumer loans is presented by class in 
the age analysis section while the performing versus nonperforming 
status is presented in the table below. Refer to the nonaccrual loans 

and leases section of Note 1 for additional delinquency and 
nonperforming information.

Impaired Loans and Leases 
Larger commercial loans and leases included within aggregate 

borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit 

probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual 
review for impairment. The Bancorp also performs an individual 
review on loans and leases that are restructured in a TDR. The 
Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of 

any guarantees, the loan structure, and other factors when 
evaluating whether an individual loan or lease is impaired. Other 
factors may include the geography and industry of the borrower, 

size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and 

leverage of the borrower, and the Bancorp™s evaluation of the 
borrower™s management. Smaller balance homogenous loans or 
leases that are collectively evaluated for impairment are not 

included in the following tables.  The following tables summarize the Bancorp™s impaired loans and leases (by class) that were subject to individual review, which

A Troubled Debt Restructurings  
If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the Bancorp may 

consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan 

to maximize collection of amounts due. Within each of the 

Bancorp™s loan classes, TDRs typically involve either a reduction of 

the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the loan™s 

maturity date(s) with a stated rate lower than the current market rate 
for a new loan with similar risk, or in limited circumstances, a 
reduction of the principal balance of the loan or the loan™s accrued 

interest. Modifying the terms of a loan may result in an increase or 

decrease to the ALLL depending upon the terms modified, the 
method used to measure the ALLL for a loan prior to modification, 

and whether any charge-offs were recorded on the loan before or at 
the time of modification. Refer to the ALLL section of Note 1 for 

information on the Bancorp™s ALLL methodology. Upon 
modification of a loan, the Bancorp measures the related 
impairment as the difference between the estimated future cash 
flows expected to be collected on the modified loan, discounted at 
the original effective yield of the loan, and the carrying value of the 

loan. The resulting measurement may result in the need for minimal 
or no valuation allowance because it is probable that all cash flows 
will be collected under the modified terms of the loan. In addition, 

if the stated interest rate was increased in a TDR, the cash flows on 

the modified loan, using the pre-modification interest rate as the 
discount rate, often exceed the recorded investment of the loan.  
Conversely, upon a modification that reduces the stated interest rate 

on a loan, the Bancorp recognizes an impairment loss as an increase 

to the ALLL.  If a TDR involves a reduction of the principal balance of the 
loan or the loan™s accrued interest, that amount is charged-off to the 

ALLL. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp had $89 

million and $86 million in line of credit and letter of credit

charge-off of $2 was recognized upon modification.
  The Bancorp considers TDRs that become 90 days or more past 
due under the modified terms as subsequently defaulted. For 
commercial loans not subject to individual review for impairment, 

loss rates that are applied for purposes of determining the allowance 

include historical losses associated with subsequent defaults on 
loans previously modified in a TDR. For consumer loans, the 
Bancorp performs a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the 

consumer ALLL by comparing the consumer ALLL to forecasted 

consumer losses over the projected loss emergence period (the 
forecasted losses include the impact of subsequent defaults of 
consumer TDRs). When a residential mortgage, home equity, auto 
or other consumer loan that has been modified in a TDR 

subsequently defaults, the present value of expected cash flows used 

in the measurement of the potential impairment loss is generally 

limited to the expected net proceeds from the sale of the loan™s 

underlying collateral and any resulting impairment loss is reflected as 

a charge-off or an increase in ALLL. The Bancorp fully reserves for 

credit card loans modified in a TDR that subsequently default.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    Depreciation and amortization expense related to bank premises 
and equipment was $254 million in 2014, $245 million in 2013 and 

$233 million in 2012.  At December 31, 2014 and 2013, land and improvements 
included $165 million and $196 million, respectively, associated with 
parcels of undeveloped land intended for future branch expansion. 
The Bancorp monitors changing customer preferences associated 

with the channels it uses for banking transactions to evaluate the 

efficiency, competitiveness and quality of the customer service 

experience of its retail transaction network. As part of this ongoing 

assessment the Bancorp may determine that it is no longer fully 
committed to maintaining full-service branches at certain of its 
existing banking center locations. Similarly, the Bancorp may also 
determine that it is no longer fully committed to building banking 

centers on certain parcels of land which had previously been held 

for future branch expansion. In these circumstances, the Bancorp 

performs an assessment of the recoverability of these long-lived 
assets. Impairment losses associated with such assessments and 
lower of cost or market adjustments were $20 million, $6 million 

and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 
2012, respectively. The recognized impairment losses were recorded 
in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of 
Income. The Bancorp™s assessment of the recoverability of these 
asset groups requires the exercise of judgment in projecting the 

extent and nature of their future use and the related cash flows 

which may be impacted by unanticipated events or circumstances. 
Gross occupancy expense for cancelable and noncancelable 
leases, which is included in net occupancy expense in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income, was $100 million in 2014, $98 
million in 2013 and $99 million in 2012, which was reduced by 
rental income from leased premises of $17 million in 2014, $16 

million in 2013 and $17 million in 2012. The Bancorp™s subsidiaries 

have entered into a number of noncancelable operating and capital 

lease agreements with respect to bank premises and equipment.

the acquisition of goodwill. Acquisition activity includes acquisitions 
in the respective period in addition to purchase accounting 
adjustments related to previous acquisitions. During the fourth 

quarter of 2008, the Bancorp determined that the Commercial 
Banking and Consumer Lending reporting units™ goodwill carrying 
amounts exceeded their associated implied fair values by $750 
million and $215 million, respectively. The resulting $965 million 
goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 
2008 and represents the total amount of accumulated impairment 

losses as of December 31, 2014.Changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill, by reporting unit, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follo

   The Bancorp completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of 
September 30, 2014 by performing a qualitative assessment of 

goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether any 
indicators of impairment existed. In performing this qualitative 
assessment, the Bancorp evaluated events and circumstances since 

the last impairment analysis, macroeconomic conditions, banking 

industry and market conditions, and key financial metrics of the 

Bancorp as well as reporting unit and overall Bancorp financial 
performance. After assessing the totality of the events and 
circumstances, the Bancorp determined that it was not more likely 

than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was less 
than its carrying amounts and, therefore, the first and second steps 
of the quantitative goodwill impairment test were deemed 
unnecessary. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

9. INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles, customer lists, 
non-compete agreements and cardholder relationships. Intangible 

assets are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis 
over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets have an estimated 
remaining weighted-average life at December 31, 2014 of 4.5 years.

10. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
The Bancorp, in the normal course of business, engages in a variety 
of activities that involve VIEs, which are legal entities that lack 
sufficient equity to finance their activities, or the equity investors of 
the entities as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling 

interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is generally the enterprise 
that has both the power to direct the activities most significant to 
the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb 

losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the 

VIE. For certain investment funds, the primary beneficiary is the 

enterprise that will absorb a majority of the fund™s expected losses 
or receive a majority of the fund™s expected residual returns. The 
Bancorp evaluates its interest in certain entities to determine if these 
entities meet the definition of a VIE and whether the Bancorp is the 
primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the 
variable interests it held both at inception and when there is a 

change in circumstances that requires a reconsideration. If the 

Bancorp is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it 

must account for the VIE as a consolidated subsidiary. If the 

Bancorp is determined not to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE 

but holds a variable interest in the entity, such variable interests are 

accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other 
accounting standards as appropriate.  Consolidated VIEs

                   Automobile Loan Securitization In securitization transactions that occurred during 2014 and 2013, 

the Bancorp transferred an aggregate amount of $3.8 billion and 

$1.3 billion, respectively, in consumer automobile loans to 
bankruptcy remote trusts which were deemed to be VIEs. The 
primary purposes of the VIEs were to issue asset-backed securities 
with varying levels of credit subordination and payment priority, as 
well as residual interests, and to provide the Bancorp with access to 

liquidity for its originated loans. The Bancorp retained residual 

interests in the VIEs and, therefore, has an obligation to absorb 

losses and a right to receive benefits from the VIEs that could 

potentially be significant to the VIEs. In addition, the Bancorp 
retained servicing rights for the underlying loans and, therefore, 
holds the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most 
significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. As a 
result, the Bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of 

the VIEs and, therefore, has consolidated these VIEs. The assets of 
the VIEs are restricted to the settlement of the notes and other 
obligations of the VIEs. Third-party holders of the notes do not 

have recourse to the general assets of the Bancorp. 
The economic performance of the VIEs is most significantly 
impacted by the performance of the underlying loans. The principal 
risks to which the VIEs are exposed include credit risk and 

prepayment risk. The credit and prepayment risks are managed 
through credit enhancements in the form of reserve accounts, 

overcollateralization, excess interest on the loans and the 
subordination of certain classes of asset-backed securities to other 

classes.  
CDC Investments 
CDC, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Bancorp, was 
created to invest in projects to create affordable housing, revitalize 
business and residential areas, and preserve historic landmarks. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 117  Fifth Third Bancorp 
CDC generally co-invests with other unrelated companies and/or 
individuals and typically makes investments in a separate legal entity 

that owns the property under development. The entities are usually 

formed as limited partnerships and LLCs, and CDC typically invests 

as a limited partner/investor member in the form of equity 

contributions. The economic performance of the VIEs is driven by 
the performance of their underlying investment projects as well as 
the VIEs™ ability to operate in compliance with the rules and 

regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by 

equity investments. Typically, the general partner or managing 

member will be the party that has the right to make decisions that 

will most significantly impact the economic performance of the 

entity. The Bancorp™s subsidiaries serve as the managing member of 

certain LLCs invested in business revitalization projects. The 
Bancorp has provided an indemnification guarantee to the investor 
member of these LLCs related to the qualification of tax credits 
generated by the investor members™ investment. Accordingly, the 
Bancorp concluded that it is the primary beneficiary and, therefore, 

has consolidated these VIEs. As a result, the investor members™ 

interests in these VIEs are presented as noncontrolling interests in 

the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements. This presentation 

includes reporting separately the equity attributable to the 
noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and 
Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and reporting 

separately the comprehensive income attributable to the 

noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of 

Comprehensive Income and the net income attributable to the 

noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
The Bancorp™s maximum exposure related to these indemnifications 
at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $24 million and $21 million, 
respectively, which is based on an amount required to meet the 
investor members™ defined target rate of return.

1              CDC Investments 
As noted previously, CDC typically invests in VIEs as a limited 

partner or investor member in the form of equity contributions. The 
Bancorp has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of 
these VIEs because it lacks the power to direct the activities that 
most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
underlying project or the VIEs™ ability to operate in compliance with 

the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax 

credits generated by equity investments. This power is held by the 

general partners/managing members who exercise full and exclusive 

control of the operations of the VIEs. Accordingly, the Bancorp 
accounts for these investments under the equity method of 
accounting.  The Bancorp™s funding requirements are limited to its invested 
capital and any additional unfunded commitments for future equity 

contributions. The Bancorp™s maximum exposure to loss as a result 

of its involvement with the VIEs is limited to the carrying amounts 

of the investments, including the unfunded commitments. The 

carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in other 
assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the liabilities related 
to the unfunded commitments, which are included in other liabilities 
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are included in the previous 
tables for all periods presented. The Bancorp has no other liquidity 

arrangements or obligations to purchase assets of the VIEs that 

would expose the Bancorp to a loss. In certain arrangements, the 

general partner/managing member of the VIE has guaranteed a 
level of projected tax credits to be received by the limited 
partners/investor members, thereby minimizing a portion of the 
Bancorp™s risk. 
 
Private Equity Investments 
The Bancorp, through a wholly owned subsidiary, invests as a 

limited partner in private equity funds which provide the Bancorp 

an opportunity to obtain higher rates of return on invested capital, 

while also creating cross-selling opportunities for the Bancorp™s 

commercial products. Each of the limited partnerships has an 

unrelated third-party general partner responsible for appointing the 

fund manager. The Bancorp has not been appointed fund manager 
for any of these private equity funds. The funds finance primarily all 
of their activities from the partners™ capital contributions and 

investment returns. Under the VIE consolidation guidance still 

applicable to the funds, the Bancorp has determined that it is not 
the primary beneficiary of the funds because it does not absorb a 
majority of the funds™ expected losses or receive a majority of the 

funds™ expected residual returns. Therefore, the Bancorp accounts 

for its investments in these limited partnerships under the equity 
method of accounting. 
The Bancorp is exposed to losses arising from negative 
performance of the underlying investments in the private equity 

funds. As a limited partner, the Bancorp™s maximum exposure to 
loss is limited to the carrying amounts of the investments plus 
unfunded commitments. The carrying amounts of these 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  118  Fifth Third Bancorp 
investments, which are included in other assets in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets, are included in the previous tables. Also, as of 

December 31, 2014 and 2013, the unfunded commitment amounts 

to the funds were $78 million and $90 million, respectively. The 
Bancorp made capital contributions of $27 million and $31 million 
to private equity funds during 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
Additionally, in response to the issuance of the Volcker Rule in the 

fourth quarter of 2013, the Bancorp recognized $4 million of OTTI 

on its investments in private equity funds during 2013. The Bancorp 

recognized no OTTI on its investments in private equity funds 

during 2014. Refer to Note 27 for further information.  
Loans Provided to VIEs 
The Bancorp has provided funding to certain unconsolidated VIEs 
sponsored by third parties. These VIEs are generally established to 
finance certain consumer and small business loans originated by 

third parties. The entities are primarily funded through the issuance 

of a loan from the Bancorp or syndication through which the 

Bancorp is involved. The sponsor/administrator of the entities is 

responsible for servicing the underlying assets in the VIEs. Because 

the sponsor/administrator, not the Bancorp, holds the servicing 

responsibilities, which include the establishment and employment of 
default mitigation policies and procedures, the Bancorp does not 
hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact 

the economic performance of the entity and, therefore, is not the 

primary beneficiary. The principal risk to which these entities are exposed is credit 
risk related to the underlying assets. The Bancorp™s maximum 

exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts of the loans and 

unfunded commitments to the VIEs. The Bancorp™s outstanding 
loans to these VIEs, included in commercial loans in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets, are included in the previous tables for 
all periods presented. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the 
Bancorp™s unfunded commitments to these entities were $859 

million and $962 million, respectively. The loans and unfunded 

commitments to these VIEs are included in the Bancorp™s overall 

analysis of the ALLL and reserve for unfunded commitments, 

respectively. The Bancorp does not provide any implicit or explicit 
liquidity guarantees or principal value guarantees to these VIEs. 
 Automobile Loan Securitization In March of 2013, the Bancorp recognized an immaterial loss on the 
securitization and sale of certain automobile loans with a carrying 

amount of approximately $509 million. The securitization and the 

resulting sale of all underlying securities qualified for sale 

accounting. The Bancorp has concluded that it is not the primary 

beneficiary of the trust because it has neither the obligation to 
absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the 
VIE nor the right to receive benefits from the entity that could 
potentially be significant to the VIE. The Bancorp is not required 
and does not currently intend to provide any additional financial 

support to the trust. Investors and creditors only have recourse to 

the assets held by the trust. The interest the Bancorp holds in the 

VIE relates to servicing rights that are included in the Consolidated 

Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure to loss is equal to the 
carrying value of the servicing asset.  Restructured Loans As part of loan restructuring efforts, the Bancorp received equity 

capital from certain borrowers to facilitate the restructuring of the 

borrower™s loans. These borrowers meet the definition of a VIE 

because the Bancorp was involved in their refinancing and because 

their equity capital at risk was insufficient to fund ongoing 

operations. The Bancorp accounted for its equity capital 
investments in these VIEs under the equity method or cost method 
of accounting based on its percentage of ownership and ability to 

exercise significant influence. The Bancorp™s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its 
involvement with these VIEs was limited to the equity capital 
investments, the principal and accrued interest on the outstanding 

loans, and any unfunded commitments. The Bancorp had 

outstanding loans to these VIEs included in commercial loans in the 

Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp had no unfunded loan 

commitments to these VIEs as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. 

The loans to these VIEs are included in the Bancorp™s overall 

analysis of the ALLL. The Bancorp does not provide any implicit or 
explicit liquidity guarantees or principal value guarantees to these 
VIEs. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

11. SALES OF RECEIVABLES AND SERVICING RIGHTS 
Automobile Loan Securitization 
In March of 2013, the Bancorp recognized an immaterial loss on the 

securitization and sale of certain automobile loans with a carrying 

amount of approximately $509 million. The Bancorp utilized a 
securitization trust to facilitate the securitization process. The trust 
issued asset-backed securities in the form of notes and equity 
certificates, with varying levels of credit subordination and payment 

priority. The Bancorp does not hold any of the notes or equity 

certificates issued by the trust, and the investors in these securities 

have no credit recourse to the Bancorp™s assets for failure of debtors 

to pay when due. As part of the sale, the Bancorp obtained servicing 
responsibilities and recognized a servicing asset with an initial fair 
value of $6 million. 
 
Residential Mortgage Loan Sales 
The Bancorp sold fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage 
loans during 2014, 2013 and 2012. In those sales, the Bancorp 

obtained servicing responsibilities and the investors have no 

recourse to the Bancorp™s other assets for failure of debtors to pay 
when due. The Bancorp receives annual servicing fees based on a 

percentage of the outstanding balance. The Bancorp identifies 

classes of servicing assets based on financial asset type and interest 
rates.

    Temporary impairment or impairment recovery, affected through a 
change in the MSR valuation allowance, is captured as a component 

of mortgage banking net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of 

Income. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy 
to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value 
of the MSR portfolio. This strategy includes the purchase of free-
standing derivatives and various available-for-sale securities. The 
interest income, mark-to-market adjustments and gain or loss from 
sale activities associated with these portfolios are expected to 

economically hedge a portion of the change in value of the MSR 

portfolio caused by fluctuating discount rates, earnings rates and 

prepayment speeds.
The fair value of the servicing asset is based on 
the present value of expected future cash flows.

N/A    Based on historical credit experience, expected credit losses for 
residential mortgage loan servicing assets have been deemed 

immaterial, as the Bancorp sold the majority of the underlying loans 
without recourse. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp 
serviced $65.4 billion and $69.2 billion, respectively, of residential 
mortgage loans for other investors. The value of MSRs that 

continue to be held by the Bancorp is subject to credit, prepayment 
and interest rate risks on the sold financial assets.   
                                    At December 31, 2014, the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate 10%, 20% and 50% adverse cha

.   These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. 

As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on these 

variations in the assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated 
because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change 
in fair value may not be linear. The Bancorp believes variations of 
these levels are reasonably possible; however, there is the potential 

that adverse changes in key assumptions could be even greater. 

Also, in the previous table, the effect of a variation in a particular 

assumption on the fair value of the interests that continue to be held 
by the Bancorp is calculated without changing any other 
assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in 

another (for example, increases in market interest rates may result in 
lower prepayments), which might magnify or counteract these 
sensitivities. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

12. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Bancorp maintains an overall risk management strategy that 
incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce certain risks 

related to interest rate, prepayment and foreign currency volatility. 

Additionally, the Bancorp holds derivative instruments for the 
benefit of its commercial customers and for other business 
purposes. The Bancorp does not enter into unhedged speculative 
derivative positions. 

 The Bancorp™s interest rate risk management strategy involves 

modifying the repricing characteristics of certain financial 

instruments so that changes in interest rates do not adversely affect 

the Bancorp™s net interest margin and cash flows. Derivative 
instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk 
management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, 
interest rate caps, forward contracts, options and swaptions. Interest 
rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest payments, such as 

fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on a stated 

notional amount and maturity date. Interest rate floors protect 

against declining rates, while interest rate caps protect against rising 
interest rates. Forward contracts are contracts in which the buyer 
agrees to purchase, and the seller agrees to make delivery of, a 
specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. 
Options provide the purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, 

to purchase or sell a contracted item during a specified period at an 

agreed upon price. Swaptions are financial instruments granting the 

owner the right, but not the obligation, to enter into or cancel a 

swap.  Prepayment volatility arises mostly from changes in fair value 
of the largely fixed-rate MSR portfolio, mortgage loans and 
mortgage-backed securities. The Bancorp may enter into various 
free-standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate 

swaptions, interest rate floors, mortgage options, TBAs and interest 

rate swaps) to economically hedge prepayment volatility. Principal-

only swaps are total return swaps based on changes in the value of 
the underlying mortgage principal-only trust.
 TBAs are a forward 
purchase agreement for a mortgage-backed securities trade whereby 

the terms of the security are undefined at the time the trade is made. 
 Foreign currency volatility occurs as the Bancorp enters into 
certain loans denominated in foreign currencies. Derivative 

instruments that the Bancorp may use to economically hedge these 

foreign denominated loans include foreign exchange swaps and 
forward contracts. 
 The Bancorp also enters into derivative contracts (including 
foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts and interest rate 

contracts) for the benefit of commercial customers and other 
business purposes. The Bancorp may economically hedge significant 
exposures related to these free-standing derivatives by entering into 

offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable 

counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies. 
Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to 
meet the terms of their contracts. The Bancorp™s exposure is limited 

to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, 

principal or contract amounts. Credit risk is minimized through 
credit approvals, limits, counterparty collateral and monitoring 
procedures.  
 The Bancorp™s derivative assets include certain contractual 

features in which the Bancorp requires the counterparties to provide 
collateral in the form of cash and securities to offset changes in the 
fair value of the derivatives, including changes in the fair value due 
to credit risk of the counterparty. As of December 31, 2014 and 

2013, the balance of collateral held by the Bancorp for derivative 
assets was $830 million and $514 million, respectively. The credit 

component negatively impacting the fair value of derivative assets 

associated with customer accommodation contracts as of December 
31, 2014 and 2013 was $16 million and $12 million, respectively.  In measuring the fair value of derivative liabilities, the Bancorp 
considers its own credit risk, taking into consideration collateral 
maintenance requirements of certain derivative counterparties and 

the duration of instruments with counterparties that do not require 

collateral maintenance. When necessary, the Bancorp posts 

collateral primarily in the form of cash and securities to offset 

changes in fair value of the derivatives, including changes in fair 
value due to the Bancorp™s credit risk. As of December 31, 2014 and 
2013, the balance of collateral posted by the Bancorp for derivative 
liabilities was $574 million and $559 million, respectively. Certain of 

the Bancorp™s derivative liabilities contain credit-risk related 

contingent features that could result in the requirement to post 

additional collateral upon the occurrence of specified events. As of 

December 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair value of the additional 
collateral that could be required to be posted as a result of the 
credit-risk related contingent features being triggered was immaterial 
to the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial Statements.
 The posting of 
collateral has been determined to remove the need for further 

consideration of credit risk. As a result, the Bancorp determined 

that the impact of the Bancorp™s credit risk to the valuation of its 

derivative liabilities was immaterial to the Bancorp™s Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
 The Bancorp holds certain derivative instruments that qualify 

for hedge accounting treatment and are designated as either fair 
value hedges or cash flow hedges. Derivative instruments that do 
not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, or for which hedge 

accounting is not established, are held as free-standing derivatives. 

All customer accommodation derivatives are held as free-standing 

derivatives. 
 The fair value of derivative instruments is presented on a gross 
basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to master 

netting arrangements. Derivative instruments with a positive fair 
value are reported in other assets in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets while derivative instruments with a negative fair value are 

reported in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash 
collateral payables and receivables associated with the derivative 
instruments are not added to or netted against the fair value 

amounts. For further information on offsetting derivatives, refer to 

Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 123  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Fair Value Hedges 
The Bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert its fixed-
rate funding to floating-rate. Decisions to convert fixed-rate funding 

to floating are made primarily through consideration of the 

asset/liability mix of the Bancorp, the desired asset/liability 

sensitivity and interest rate levels. As of December 31, 2014 and 
2013, certain interest rate swaps met the criteria required to qualify 
for the shortcut method of accounting. Based on this shortcut 

method of accounting treatment, no ineffectiveness is assumed. For 

interest rate swaps that do not meet the shortcut requirements, an 

assessment of hedge effectiveness using regression analysis was 
performed and such swaps were accounted for using the ﬁlong-
haulﬂ method. The long-haul method requires a quarterly 

assessment of hedge effectiveness and measurement of 

ineffectiveness. For interest rate swaps accounted for as a fair value 

hedge using the long-haul method, ineffectiveness is the difference 

between the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and 
changes in fair value of the related hedged item attributable to the 
risk being hedged. The ineffectiveness on interest rate swaps 

hedging fixed-rate funding is reported within interest expense in the 

Consolidated Statements of Income.   
 The following table reflects the change in fair value of interest rate contracts, designated as fair value hedges, as well as t
he change in fair value o

 Cash Flow Hedges 
The Bancorp may enter into interest rate swaps to convert floating-
rate assets and liabilities to fixed rates or to hedge certain forecasted 

transactions. The assets or liabilities may be grouped in 
circumstances where they share the same risk exposure that the 
Bancorp desires to hedge. The Bancorp may also enter into interest 

rate caps and floors to limit cash flow variability of floating rate 
assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2014, all hedges designated as cash flow hedges were assessed for effectiveness using regression 

analysis. Ineffectiveness is generally measured as the amount by 

which the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging 

instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative change in 
the hedged item™s expected cash flows attributable to the risk being 
hedged. Ineffectiveness is reported within other noninterest income 

in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The effective portion of 
the cumulative gains or losses on cash flow hedges are reported 
within AOCI and are reclassified from AOCI to current period 

earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. As of 

December 31, 2014, the maximum length of time over which the 
Bancorp is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash 
flows is 60 months. 

 Reclassified gains and losses on interest rate contracts related 

to commercial and industrial loans are recorded within interest 
income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 
31, 2014 and 2013, $23 million and $13 million, respectively, of net 

deferred gains, net of tax, on cash flow hedges were recorded in 
AOCI in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 
2014, $33 million in net deferred gains, net of tax, recorded in 

AOCI are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 

twelve months. This amount could differ from amounts actually 

recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, 
and the addition of other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2014. 
 During 2014 and 2013, there were no gains or losses 

reclassified from accumulated AOCI into earnings associated with 
the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because it was probable that 
the original forecasted transaction would no longer occur by the end 

of the originally specified time period or within the additional period 

of time as defined by U.S. GAAP.

Free-Standing Derivative Instruments Œ Risk Management 
and Other Business Purposes 
As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its 
mortgage banking activity, the Bancorp may enter into various free-

standing derivatives (principal-only swaps, interest rate swaptions, 

interest rate floors, mortgage options, TBAs and interest rate swaps) 
to economically hedge changes in fair value of its largely fixed-rate 
MSR portfolio. Principal-only swaps hedge the mortgage-LIBOR 

spread because these swaps appreciate in value as a result of 
tightening spreads. Principal-only swaps also provide prepayment 
protection by increasing in value when prepayment speeds increase, 

as opposed to MSRs that lose value in a faster prepayment 

environment. Receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps and 
swaptions increase in value when interest rates do not increase as 
quickly as expected.  The Bancorp enters into forward contracts and mortgage 
options to economically hedge the change in fair value of certain 
residential mortgage loans held for sale due to changes in interest 

rates. IRLCs issued on residential mortgage loan commitments that 

will be held for sale are also considered free-standing derivative 

instruments and the interest rate exposure on these commitments is 

economically hedged primarily with forward contracts. Revaluation 
gains and losses from free-standing derivatives related to mortgage 
banking activity are recorded as a component of mortgage banking 
net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 Additionally, as part of the Bancorp™s overall risk management 

strategy with respect to minimizing significant fluctuations in 

earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate and prepayment 

volatility, the Bancorp may enter into free-standing derivative 
instruments (options, swaptions and interest rate swaps). The gains 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  124  Fifth Third Bancorp 
and losses on these derivative contracts are recorded within other 
noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

 In conjunction with the initial sale of the Bancorp™s 51% 

interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC, the Bancorp received a warrant 
and issued a put option, which are accounted for as free-standing 
derivatives. The put option expired as a result of the Vantiv, Inc. 
IPO in March of 2012. Refer to Note 27 for further discussion of 

significant inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of the 

warrant.  In conjunction with the sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares in 
2009, the Bancorp entered into a total return swap in which the 

Bancorp will make or receive payments based on subsequent 

changes in the conversion rate of the Class B shares into Class A 
shares. This total return swap is accounted for as a free-standing 
derivative. Refer to Note 27 for further discussion of significant 

inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of this instrument.  
 The net gains (losses) recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income relating to free-standing derivative instruments used 
for risk management and other business purposes are summarized in the following table:

 Free-Standing Derivative Instruments Œ Customer 
Accommodation The majority of the free-standing derivative instruments the 

Bancorp enters into are for the benefit of its commercial customers. 

These derivative contracts are not designated against specific assets 
or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or to forecasted 
transactions and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. 
These instruments include foreign exchange derivative contracts 
entered into for the benefit of commercial customers involved in 

international trade to hedge their exposure to foreign currency 

fluctuations and commodity contracts to hedge such items as 

natural gas and various other derivative contracts. The Bancorp may 

economically hedge significant exposures related to these derivative 
contracts entered into for the benefit of customers by entering into 
offsetting contracts with approved, reputable, independent 
counterparties with substantially matching terms. The Bancorp 
hedges its interest rate exposure on commercial customer 

transactions by executing offsetting swap agreements with primary 

dealers. Revaluation gains and losses on interest rate, foreign 

exchange, commodity and other commercial customer derivative 
contracts are recorded as a component of corporate banking 
revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  
 The Bancorp enters into risk participation agreements, under 
which the Bancorp assumes credit exposure relating to certain 

underlying interest rate derivative contracts. The Bancorp only 

enters into these risk participation agreements in instances in which 

the Bancorp has participated in the loan that the underlying interest 

rate derivative contract was designed to hedge. The Bancorp will 
make payments under these agreements if a customer defaults on its 
obligation to perform under the terms of the underlying interest rate 
derivative contract. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the total 

notional amount of the risk participation agreements was $1.1 

billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and the fair value was a liability 

of $2 million at December 31, 2014 and $3 million at December 31, 

2013, which is included in interest rate contracts for customers. As 
of December 31, 2014, the risk participation agreements had an 
average remaining life of 2.6 years. 
 The Bancorp™s maximum exposure in the risk participation 
agreements is contingent on the fair value of the underlying interest 

rate derivative contracts in an asset position at the time of default. 

The Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with the underlying 

customers in the risk participation agreements through the same risk 
grading system currently utilized for establishing loss reserves in its 
loan and lease portfolio.  Risk ratings of the notional amount of risk participation agreements under this risk rating system are summarized in the follow

13. OFFSETTING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Bancorp™s derivative transactions are generally governed by 
ISDA Master Agreements and similar arrangements, which include 
provisions governing the setoff of assets and liabilities between the 
parties. When the Bancorp has more than one outstanding 

derivative transaction with a single counterparty, the setoff 
provisions contained within these agreements generally allow the 
non-defaulting party the right to reduce its liability to the defaulting 

party by amounts eligible for setoff, including the collateral received 
as well as eligible offsetting transactions with that counterparty, 
irrespective of the currency, place of payment, or booking office. 
The Bancorp™s policy is to present its derivative assets and derivative 
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis, even 

when provisions allowing for setoff are in place. 

 Collateral amounts included in the tables below consist 

primarily of cash and highly-rated government-backed securities.

PARENT COMPANY LONG-TERM BORROWINGS
  Senior Notes 
On January 25, 2011, the Bancorp issued and sold $1.0 billion of 
senior notes to third party investors. The senior notes bear a fixed-

rate of interest of 3.625% per annum. The notes are unsecured, 
senior obligations of the Bancorp. Payment of the full principal 
amounts of the notes is due upon maturity on January 25, 2016. The 
notes are not subject to redemption at the Bancorp™s option at any 

time prior to maturity. 
On March 7, 2012, the Bancorp issued and sold $500 million of 
senior notes to third party investors, and entered into a 

Supplemental Indenture dated March 7, 2012 with the Trustee, 

which modified the existing Indenture for Senior Debt Securities 

dated April 30, 2008. The Supplemental Indenture and the 
Indenture define the rights of the senior notes, which senior notes 
are represented by a Global Security dated as of March 7, 2012. The 

senior notes bear a fixed-rate of interest of 3.50% per annum. The 
notes are unsecured, senior obligations of the Bancorp. Payment of 
the full principal amounts of the notes will be due upon maturity on 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 129  Fifth Third Bancorp 
March 15, 2022. The notes are not subject to redemption at the 
Bancorp™s option at any time until 30 days prior to maturity. 
On February 28, 2014, the Bancorp issued and sold $500 
million of senior notes to third party investors. The senior notes 

bear a fixed-rate of interest of 2.30% per annum. The notes are 

unsecured, senior obligations of the Bancorp. Payment of the full 
principal amounts of the notes is due upon maturity on March 1, 
2019. The notes are not subject to redemption at the Bancorp™s 

option at any time until 30 days prior to maturity. 

 Subordinated Debt 
The subordinated floating-rate notes due in 2016 pay interest at 

three-month LIBOR plus 42 bps. The Bancorp has entered into 

interest rate swaps to convert its subordinated fixed-rate notes due 
in 2017 and 2018 to floating-rate, which pay interest at three-month 
LIBOR plus 42 bps and 25 bps, respectively, at December 31, 2014. 
The rates paid on the swaps hedging the subordinated floating-rate 
notes due in 2017 and 2018 were 0.69% and 0.48%, respectively, at 

December 31, 2014. Of the $1.0 billion in 8.25% subordinated 

fixed-rate notes due in 2038, $705 million were subsequently hedged 

to floating and paid a rate of 3.28% at December 31, 2014.   
On November 20, 2013, the Bancorp issued and sold $750 
million of 4.30% unsecured subordinated fixed-rate notes with a 
maturity date of January 16, 2024. These fixed-rate notes will be 
redeemable by the Bancorp, in whole or in part, on or after the date 

that is 30 days prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal 

to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

up to, but excluding, the redemption date.  SUBSIDIARY LONG-TERM BORROWINGS 
 Senior and Subordinated Debt 
Medium-term senior notes and subordinated bank notes with 

maturities ranging from one year to 30 years can be issued by the 

Bancorp™s banking subsidiary. On February 25, 2013, the Bancorp™s 
banking subsidiary updated and amended its existing global bank 
note program. The amended global bank note program increased 
the Bank™s capacity to issue its senior and subordinated unsecured 
bank notes from $20 billion to $25 billion. As of December 31, 

2014, $19.1 billion was available for future issuance under the global 

bank note program. For the subordinated fixed-rate bank notes due 

in 2015, the Bancorp entered into interest rate swaps to convert the 

fixed-rate debt into floating-rate. At December 31, 2014, the 
weighted-average rate paid on the swaps was 0.33%. 
On February 28, 2013, the Bank issued and sold, under its 
amended bank notes program, $1.3 billion in aggregate principal 

amount of unsecured senior bank notes. The bank notes consisted 

of: $600 million of 1.45% senior fixed-rate notes due on 

February 28, 2018; $400 million of 0.90% senior fixed-rate notes 

due on February 26, 2016; and $300 million of senior floating-rate 

notes due on February 26, 2016. Interest on the floating-rate notes 
is 3-month LIBOR plus 41 bps. These bank notes will be 
redeemable by the Bank, in whole or in part, on or after the date 
that is 30 days prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal 

to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

through the redemption date.  
On November 20, 2013, the Bank issued and sold, under its 
amended bank notes program, $1.8 billion in aggregate principal 

amount of unsecured senior bank notes. The bank notes consisted 
of $1.0 billion of 1.15% senior fixed-rate notes due on 
November 18, 2016 and $750 million of senior floating-rate notes 
due on November 18, 2016. Interest on the floating-rate notes is 3-

month LIBOR plus 51 bps. These bank notes will be redeemable by 

the Bank, in whole or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days 

prior to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of 
the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but 
excluding, the redemption date. 
On April 25, 2014, the Bank issued and sold, under its 
amended bank notes program, $1.5 billion in aggregate principal 

amount of unsecured senior bank notes. The bank notes consisted 

of $850 million of 2.375% senior fixed-rate notes due on April 25, 
2019 and $650 million of 1.35% senior fixed-rate notes due on June 
1, 2017. These bank notes will be redeemable by the Bank, in whole 

or in part, on or after the date that is 30 days prior to the maturity 

date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount 

plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the 

redemption date. On September 5, 2014, the Bank issued and sold, under its 
amended bank notes program, $850 million of 2.875% unsecured 
senior fixed-rate bank notes with a maturity date of October 1, 
2021. These bank notes will be redeemable by the Bank, in whole or 

in part, on or after the date that is 30 days prior to the maturity date 

at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus 
accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption 
date.  Junior Subordinated Debt 
The junior subordinated floating-rate bank notes due in 2035 were 

assumed by the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary as part of the 

acquisition of First Charter in May 2008. The obligation was issued 
to First Charter Capital Trust I and II, respectively. The notes of 
First Charter Capital Trust I and II pay a floating-rate at three-

month LIBOR plus 169 bps and 142 bps, respectively. The Bank 

has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all obligations under the 

acquired TruPS issued by First Charter Capital Trust I and II.  
 FHLB Advances 
At December 31, 2014, FHLB advances have rates ranging from 

0.05% to 6.87%, with interest payable monthly. The advances are 

secured by certain residential mortgage loans and securities totaling 
$20.5 billion. The $41 million in remaining advances mature as 
follows: $2 million in 2015, $3 million in 2016, $1 million in 2017, 

$4 million in 2018, $9 million in 2019 and $22 million thereafter.  Notes Associated with Consolidated VIE 
As previously discussed in Note 10, the Bancorp was determined to 

be the primary beneficiary of various VIEs associated with 

automobile loan securitizations completed during the years ended 

December 31, 2014 and 2013. As such, $3.4 billion of long-term 
debt related to these VIEs was consolidated in the Bancorp™s 
Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2014. Third-
party holders of this debt do not have recourse to the general assets 
of the Bancorp.

17. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND GUARANTEES 
The Bancorp, in the normal course of business, enters into financial 
instruments and various agreements to meet the financing needs of 
its customers. The Bancorp also enters into certain transactions and 
agreements to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks, provide 

funding, equipment and locations for its operations and invest in its 
communities. These instruments and agreements involve, to varying 
degrees, elements of credit risk, counterparty risk and market risk in 
excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets. The creditworthiness of counterparties for all instruments 
and agreements is evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance 
with the Bancorp™s credit policies. The Bancorp™s significant 

commitments, contingent liabilities and guarantees in excess of the 

amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are 

discussed in further detail below: Commitments
   The Bancorp has certain commitments to make future payments under contracts. The following table reflects a summary of signific

 Commitments to extend credit 
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend, typically 
having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may 

require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments to extend 

credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment 
amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. 
The Bancorp is exposed to credit risk in the event of 

nonperformance by the counterparty for the amount of the 

contract. Fixed-rate commitments are also subject to market risk 
resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and the Bancorp™s 
exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments. 
As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp had a reserve for 

unfunded commitments, including letters of credit, totaling $135 

million and $162 million, respectively, included in other liabilities in 
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp monitors the credit 
risk associated with commitments to extend credit using the same 

risk rating system utilized within its loan and lease portfolio.  Risk ratings under this risk rating system are summarized in the following table as of December 31:

 Standby letters of credit accounted for 97% of total letters of credit 

at December 31, 2014 and 2013 and are considered guarantees in 

accordance with U.S. GAAP. Approximately 60% and 48% of the 
total standby letters of credit were collateralized as of December 31, 
2014 and 2013, respectively. In the event of nonperformance by the 
customers, the Bancorp has rights to the underlying collateral, 
which can include commercial real estate, physical plant and 
property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities. At 
December 31, 2014 and 2013 the reserve related to these standby 

letters of credit was $1 million and $2 million, respectively, and is 

included in the total reserve for unfunded commitments. The 
Bancorp monitors the credit risk associated with letters of credit 
using the same risk rating system utilized within its loan and lease 
portfolio.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp had outstanding 
letters of credit that were supporting certain securities issued as 
VRDNs. The Bancorp facilitates financing for its commercial 

customers, which consist of companies and municipalities, by 

marketing the VRDNs to investors. The VRDNs pay interest to 
holders at a rate of interest that fluctuates based upon market 
demand. The VRDNs generally have long-term maturity dates, but 

can be tendered by the holder for purchase at par value upon proper 

advance notice. When the VRDNs are tendered, a remarketing 
agent generally finds another investor to purchase the VRDNs to 
keep the securities outstanding in the market. As of December 31, 

2014 and 2013, total VRDNs in which the Bancorp was the 

remarketing agent or were supported by a Bancorp letter of credit 
were $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion of which FTS acted as the 

remarketing agent to issuers on $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion, 
respectively. As remarketing agent, FTS is responsible for finding 

purchasers for VRDNs that are put by investors. The Bancorp 
issued letters of credit, as a credit enhancement, to $1.2 billion and 
$1.5 billion of the VRDNs remarketed by FTS, in addition to $247 

million and $300 million in VRDNs remarketed by third parties at 
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These letters of credit 
are included in the total letters of credit balance provided in the 

previous table. 
 
Forward contracts to sell mortgage loans 
The Bancorp enters into forward contracts to economically hedge 
the change in fair value of certain residential mortgage loans held 
for sale due to changes in interest rates. The outstanding notional 
amounts of these forward contracts are included in the summary of 

significant commitments table for all periods presented. 

 
Noncancelable lease obligations and other commitments 

The Bancorp™s subsidiaries have entered into a number of 
noncancelable lease agreements. The minimum rental commitments 
under noncancelable lease agreements are shown in the summary of 
significant commitments table. The Bancorp has also entered into a 
limited number of agreements for work related to banking center 

construction and to purchase goods or services.  

 Contingent Liabilities 
 Private mortgage reinsurance For certain mortgage loans originated by the Bancorp, borrowers 

may be required to obtain PMI provided by third-party insurers. In 

some instances, these insurers cede a portion of the PMI premiums 
to the Bancorp, and the Bancorp provides reinsurance coverage 
within a specified range of the total PMI coverage. The Bancorp™s 

reinsurance coverage typically ranges from 5% to 10% of the total 

PMI coverage. The Bancorp™s maximum exposure in the event of 
nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the 
Bancorp™s total outstanding reinsurance coverage, which was $29 

million at December 31, 2014 and $37 million at December 31, 

2013. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp maintained a reserve of $2 million and $10 million, respectively, related to 
exposures within the reinsurance portfolio which was included in 
other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2009, the 
Bancorp suspended the practice of providing reinsurance of PMI 
for newly originated mortgage loans. 
 Legal claims 
There are legal claims pending against the Bancorp and its 

subsidiaries that have arisen in the normal course of business. Refer 

to Note 18 for additional information regarding these proceedings. 

 Guarantees 
The Bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of 

certain events under financial guarantees provided in certain 

contractual arrangements as discussed in the following sections. 
 Residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions 

Conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third 

parties are generally sold with representation and warranty 
provisions. A contractual liability arises only in the event of a breach 
of these representations and warranties and, in general, only when a 

loss results from the breach. The Bancorp may be required to 

repurchase any previously sold loan or indemnify (make whole) the 
investor or insurer for which the representation or warranty of the 

Bancorp proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading.   

 The Bancorp establishes a residential mortgage repurchase 
reserve related to various representations and warranties that reflects 
management™s estimate of losses based on a combination of factors. 
The Bancorp™s estimation process requires management to make 

subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently 
uncertain, such as, future demand expectations, economic factors 
and the specific characteristics of the loans subject to repurchase. 

Such factors incorporate historical investor audit and repurchase 

demand rates, appeals success rates, historical loss severity and any 

additional information obtained from the GSEs regarding future 
mortgage repurchase and file request criteria. At the time of a loan 
sale, the Bancorp records a representation and warranty reserve at 
the estimated fair value of the Bancorp™s guarantee and continually 

updates the reserve during the life of the loan as losses in excess of 
the reserve become probable and reasonably estimable. The 

provision for the estimated fair value of the representation and 

warranty guarantee arising from the loan sales is recorded as an 

adjustment to the gain on sale, which is included in other 
noninterest income at the time of sale. Updates to the reserve are 
recorded in other noninterest expense. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Bancorp settled certain 
repurchase claims related to mortgage loans originated and sold to 

FHLMC prior to January 1, 2009 for $25 million, after paid claim 

credits and other adjustments. The settlement removes the 

Bancorp™s responsibility to repurchase or indemnify FHLMC for 

representation and warranty violations on any loan sold prior to 
January 1, 2009 except in limited circumstances.  
 As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp maintained 
reserves related to loans sold with representation and warranty 

provisions totaling $35 million and $44 million, respectively, 
included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  132  Fifth Third Bancorp 
The Bancorp uses the best information available to it in 
estimating its mortgage representation and warranty reserve, 

however, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and 

imprecise and, accordingly, losses in excess of the amounts accrued 
as of December 31, 2014, are reasonably possible. The Bancorp 
currently estimates that it is reasonably possible that it could incur 
losses related to mortgage representation and warranty provisions in 

an amount up to approximately $57 million in excess of amounts 

reserved. This estimate was derived by modifying the key 

assumptions discussed above to reflect management's judgment 

regarding reasonably possible adverse changes to those assumptions. 

The actual repurchase losses could vary significantly from the 
recorded mortgage representation and warranty reserve or this 
estimate of reasonably possibly losses, depending on the outcome of 

various factors, including those noted above. 
During 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp paid $11 million and $64 
million, respectively, in the form of make whole payments and 
repurchased $59 million and $89 million, respectively, in 
outstanding principal of loans to satisfy investor demands. Total 
repurchase demand requests during 2014 and 2013 were $97 million 

and $263 million, respectively. Total outstanding repurchase 

demand inventory was $7 million at December 31, 2014 compared 

to $46 million at December 31, 2013.   The following table summarizes activity in the reserve for representation and warranty provisions for the years ended:

 Residential mortgage loans sold with credit recourse The Bancorp sold certain residential mortgage loans in the 

secondary market with credit recourse. In the event of any customer 

default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, the Bancorp is 
required to reimburse the third party. The maximum amount of 
credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the underlying 
borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance. In the 
event of nonperformance, the Bancorp has rights to the underlying 

collateral value securing the loan. The outstanding balances on these 

loans sold with credit recourse were $548 million and $579 million 

at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and the delinquency 

rates were 4.0% at December 31, 2014 and 4.4% at December 31, 
2013. The Bancorp maintained an estimated credit loss reserve on 
these loans sold with credit recourse of $11 million at December 31, 
2014 and $16 million at December 31, 2013 recorded in other 
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To determine the 

credit loss reserve, the Bancorp used an approach that is consistent 

with its overall approach in estimating credit losses for various 

categories of residential mortgage loans held in its loan portfolio. 

 Margin accounts 
FTS, a subsidiary of the Bancorp, guarantees the collection of all 
margin account balances held by its brokerage clearing agent for the 

benefit of its customers. FTS is responsible for payment to its 
brokerage clearing agent for any loss, liability, damage, cost or 
expense incurred as a result of customers failing to comply with 

margin or margin maintenance calls on all margin accounts. The 

margin account balance held by the brokerage clearing agent was 

$13 million at December 31, 2014 and $12 million at December 31, 
2013. In the event of any customer default, FTS has rights to the 
underlying collateral provided. Given the existence of the underlying 
collateral provided and negligible historical credit losses, the 

Bancorp does not maintain a loss reserve related to the margin 
accounts. 
 
Long-term borrowing obligations 
The Bancorp had certain fully and unconditionally guaranteed long-
term borrowing obligations issued by wholly-owned issuing trust 
entities of $62 million as of December 31, 2014.  
 Visa litigation 
The Bancorp, as a member bank of Visa prior to Visa™s 

reorganization and IPO (the ﬁIPOﬂ) of its Class A common shares 

(the ﬁClass A Sharesﬂ) in 2008, had certain indemnification 

obligations pursuant to Visa™s certificate of incorporation and by-
laws and in accordance with their membership agreements. In 
accordance with Visa™s by-laws prior to the IPO, the Bancorp could 
have been required to indemnify Visa for the Bancorp™s 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 133  Fifth Third Bancorp 
proportional share of losses based on the pre-IPO membership 
interests. As part of its reorganization and IPO, the Bancorp™s 

indemnification obligation was modified to include only certain 

known litigation (the ﬁCovered Litigationﬂ) as of the date of the 

restructuring. This modification triggered a requirement for the 

Bancorp to recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the 
indemnification liability.  In conjunction with the IPO, the Bancorp received 10.1 million 
of Visa™s Class B common shares (the ﬁClass B Sharesﬂ) based on 

the Bancorp™s membership percentage in Visa prior to the IPO. The 

Class B Shares are not transferable (other than to another member 

bank) until the later of the third anniversary of the IPO closing or 

the date which the Covered Litigation has been resolved; therefore, 

the Bancorp™s Class B Shares were classified in other assets and 
accounted for at their carryover basis of $0. Visa deposited $3 
billion of the proceeds from the IPO into a litigation escrow 

account, established for the purpose of funding judgments in, or 

settlements of, the Covered Litigation. If Visa™s litigation committee 

determines that the escrow account is insufficient, then Visa will 
issue additional Class A Shares and deposit the proceeds from the 
sale of the Class A Shares into the litigation escrow account. When 

Visa funds the litigation escrow account, the Class B Shares are 
subject to dilution through an adjustment in the conversion rate of 
Class B Shares into Class A Shares.  
In 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of the Class B Shares 
and entered into a total return swap in which the Bancorp will make 
or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion 
rate of the Class B Shares into Class A Shares. The swap terminates 

on the later of the third anniversary of Visa™s IPO or the date on 

which the Covered Litigation is settled. Refer to Note 27 for 
additional information on the valuation of the swap. The 
counterparty to the swap as a result of its ownership of the Class B 
Shares will be impacted by dilutive adjustments to the conversion 
rate of the Class B Shares into Class A Shares caused by any 

Covered Litigation losses in excess of the litigation escrow account. 

If actual judgments in, or settlements of, the Covered Litigation 

significantly exceed current expectations, then additional funding by 

Visa of the litigation escrow account and the resulting dilution of 
the Class B Shares could result in a scenario where the Bancorp™s 
ultimate exposure associated with the Covered Litigation (the ﬁVisa 

Litigation Exposureﬂ) exceeds the value of the Class B Shares 

owned by the swap counterparty (the ﬁClass B Valueﬂ). In the event 

the Bancorp concludes that it is probable that the Visa Litigation 

Exposure exceeds the Class B Value, the Bancorp would record a 
litigation reserve liability and a corresponding amount of other 
noninterest expense for the amount of the excess. Any such 
litigation reserve liability would be separate and distinct from the 
fair value derivative liability associated with the total return swap. 
As of the date of the Bancorp™s sale of the Class B Shares and 
through December 31, 2014, the Bancorp has concluded that it is 

not probable that the Visa Litigation Exposure will exceed the Class 
B value. Based on this determination, upon the sale of the Class B 
Shares, the Bancorp reversed its net Visa litigation reserve liability 

and recognized a free-standing derivative liability associated with the 
total return swap. The fair value of the swap liability was $49 million 
and $48 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Refer 

to Notes 12 and 18 for further information. 
After the Bancorp™s sale of the Class B Shares, Visa has funded 
additional amounts into the litigation escrow account which have 

resulted in further dilution in the conversion of Class B Shares into 
Class A Shares, and along with other terms of the total return swap, 

required the Bancorp to make cash payments to the swap 
counterparty as follows:

18. LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS 
During April 2006, the Bancorp was added as a defendant in a 
consolidated antitrust class action lawsuit originally filed against 
Visa®, MasterCard® and several other major financial institutions in 
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New 

York. The plaintiffs, merchants operating commercial businesses 
throughout the U.S. and trade associations, claimed that the 
interchange fees charged by card-issuing banks were unreasonable 

and sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages. In addition to 

being a named defendant, the Bancorp is also subject to a possible 

indemnification obligation of Visa as discussed in Note 17 and has 
also entered into judgment and loss sharing agreements with Visa, 
MasterCard and certain other named defendants. In October 2012, 

the parties to the litigation entered into a settlement agreement. The 
court entered a Class Settlement Preliminary Approval Order in 
November 2012. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, 

the Bancorp paid $46 million into a class settlement escrow account. 

Previously, the Bancorp paid an additional $4 million in another 

settlement escrow in connection with the settlement of claims from 
plaintiffs not included in the class action. More than 7,900 
merchants have requested exclusion from the class settlement. 

Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, 25% of the 

funds paid into the class settlement escrow account have been 

returned to the control of the defendants through Class Exclusion 

Takedown Payments.  Approximately 460 of the merchants who 

requested exclusion from the class have filed separate federal 

lawsuits against Visa, MasterCard and certain other defendants 
alleging similar antitrust violations.  These ﬁopt-outﬂ federal lawsuits 
have been transferred to the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of New York.  The Bancorp was not named as a 

defendant in any of the opt-out federal lawsuits, but may have 

obligations pursuant to indemnification arrangements and/or the 

judgment or loss sharing agreements noted above. In addition, one 

merchant filed a separate state court lawsuit against Visa, 
MasterCard and certain other defendants, including the Bancorp, 
alleging similar antitrust violations. On January 14, 2014, the court 
entered a final order approving the class settlement. A number of 
merchants have filed appeals from that approval.  On July 18, 2014, 

the court in which all but one of the opt-out federal lawsuits has 

been consolidated denied defendants™ motion to dismiss the 

complaints. Several of the opt-out federal lawsuits have been 
resolved.  Refer to Note 17 for further information. 
In 2008,  two cases were filed in the United States District 
Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the Bancorp and 
certain officers styled 
Dudenhoeffer v Fifth Third Bancorp et al. Case No. 
1:08-cv-538.
 The complaints alleged violations of ERISA based on 
allegations similar to those set forth in the previously reported 

securities class action cases. The ERISA actions were dismissed by 

the trial court, but the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 
trial court decision. The Bancorp petitioned the United States 
Supreme Court to review and reverse the Sixth Circuit decision and 
sought a stay of proceedings in the trial court pending appeal. On 
December 13, 2013, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and 

agreed to hear the appeal. Oral arguments were held on April 2, 

2014 and on June 25, 2014 the Supreme Court unanimously vacated 

the Sixth Circuit decision and remanded the case for further 

proceedings consistent with the standards articulated in its decision.  
The Supreme Court issued its mandate remanding the case back to 
the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals but no further proceedings have 
occurred. In November 2014, a shareholder of the Bancorp filed a 
shareholder derivative suit in the Court of Common Pleas for 

Hamilton County, Ohio, against current and former members of the 

Bancorp™s Board of Directors, the Bancorp™s former Chief Financial 

Officer and current Executive Vice President, Daniel T. Poston, the 
Bancorp™s Chief Executive Officer, Kevin T. Kabat, and, nominally, 
the Bancorp. The suit alleges breach of fiduciary duty, waste of 
corporate assets and unjust enrichment in connection with the 
Bancorp™s alleged violations of federal and state securities laws, 

among other charges, in relation to its administrative settlement 

with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission 

announced on December 4, 2013 to resolve the previously reported 

investigation of the Bancorp™s historical accounting and reporting 

with respect to certain commercial loans that were sold or 

reclassified as held for sale by the Bancorp in the fourth quarter of 
2008.  The suit seeks, among other things, unspecified monetary 
damages, disgorgement of profits, certain corporate governance and 

personnel actions and compliance and disclosure changes.  On 

January 16, 2015 a motion to dismiss the complaint was filed on 

behalf of all defendants. The impact of the final disposition of this 

lawsuit cannot be assessed at this time. 
The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are not parties to any other 
material litigation. However, there are other litigation matters that 
arise in the normal course of business. While it is impossible to 
ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with 

respect to these contingent matters, management believes any 

resulting liability from these other actions would not have a material 
effect upon the Bancorp™s consolidated financial position, results of 
operations or cash flows.  
The Bancorp and/or its affiliates are involved in information-
gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both 
formal and informal) by various governmental regulatory agencies 
and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory bodies 

regarding their respective businesses. Additional matters will likely 
arise from time to time. Any of these matters may result in material 
adverse consequences to the Bancorp, its affiliates and/or their 

respective directors, officers and other personnel, including adverse 

judgments, findings, settlements, fines, penalties, orders, injunctions 

or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of the Bancorp™s 
SEC filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or 
determinations of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls 
and procedures. Investigations by regulatory authorities may from 
time to time result in civil or criminal referrals to law enforcement 

authorities such as the Department of Justice or a United States 

Attorney. Among other matters, the Bancorp has been cooperating 

with the Department of Justice, the Department of Housing and 

Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Authority in 
civil investigations regarding compliance with requirements relating 
to certain Federal Housing Agency-insured loans and certain loans 
sold to government sponsored entities originated by affiliates of the 
Bancorp. The investigations could lead to liability under the Federal 

False Claims Act and/or the Federal Financial Institutions Reform, 
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, which allow up to treble 
and other special damages substantially in excess of actual losses. 

Additionally, the Bancorp is also cooperating with an investigation 
by the Department of Justice to determine whether the Bank 
engaged in any discriminatory practices in connection with the 
Bank's indirect automobile loan portfolio. Any claim resulting from 
this investigation could include direct and indirect damages and civil 

money penalties.  
The Bancorp is party to numerous claims and lawsuits as well 
as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters 

arising from the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of 
claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are 
inherently difficult to predict. The following factors, among others, 
contribute to this lack of predictability: plaintiff claims often include 
significant legal uncertainties, damages alleged by plaintiffs are often 

unspecified or overstated, discovery may not have started or may 

not be complete and material facts may be disputed or 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 135  Fifth Third Bancorp 
unsubstantiated. As a result of these factors, the Bancorp is not 
always able to provide an estimate of the range of reasonably 

possible outcomes for each claim. A reserve for a potential litigation 

loss is established when information related to the loss contingency 

indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss 

can be reasonably estimated. Any such reserve is adjusted from time 
to time thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. 
The Bancorp also determines, when possible (due to the 

uncertainties described above), estimates of reasonably possible 

losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses, in excess of amounts 

reserved. Under U.S. GAAP, an event is ﬁreasonably possibleﬂ if 

ﬁthe chance of the future event or events occurring is more than 

remote but less than likelyﬂ and an event is ﬁremoteﬂ if ﬁthe chance 

of the future event or events occurring is slight.ﬂ Thus, references 
to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases 
in which the Bancorp is able to estimate a range of reasonably 

possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for 

which the Bancorp believes the risk of loss is more than slight. For 

matters where the Bancorp is able to estimate such possible losses 
or ranges of possible losses, the Bancorp currently estimates that it 
is reasonably possible that it could incur losses related to legal and 

regulatory proceedings including the matters discussed above in an 
aggregate amount up to approximately $105 million in excess of 
amounts reserved, with it also being reasonably possible that no 

losses will be incurred in these matters. The estimates included in 

this amount are based on the Bancorp™s analysis of currently 

available information, and as new information is obtained the 

Bancorp may change its estimates. 
For these matters and others where an unfavorable outcome is 
reasonably possible but not probable, there may be a range of 
possible losses in excess of the established reserve that cannot be 
estimated. Based on information currently available, advice of 

counsel, available insurance coverage and established reserves, the 
Bancorp believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against 
the Bancorp and/or its subsidiaries, including the matters described 

above, will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material 

adverse effect on the Bancorp™s consolidated financial position. 

However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is 
possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters, if unfavorable, 
may be material to the Bancorp™s results of operations for any 

particular period, depending, in part, upon the size of the loss or 

liability imposed and the operating results for the applicable period. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

19. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The Bancorp maintains written policies and procedures covering 
related party transactions to principal shareholders, directors and 
executives of the Bancorp. These procedures cover transactions 
such as employee-stock purchase loans, personal lines of credit, 

residential secured loans, overdrafts, letters of credit and increases in 
indebtedness. Such transactions are subject to the Bancorp™s normal 
underwriting and approval procedures. Prior to approving a loan to 
a related party, Compliance Risk Management must review and 
determine whether the transaction requires approval from or a post 
notification to the Bancorp™s Board of Directors. At December 31, 
2014 and 2013, certain directors, executive officers, principal 

holders of Bancorp common stock, associates of such persons, and 

affiliated companies of such persons were indebted, including 

undrawn commitments to lend, to the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary.

for various business and personal interests. This indebtedness was 

incurred in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same 

terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at 
the time for comparable transactions with unrelated parties. This 
indebtedness does not involve more than the normal risk of 
repayment or present other features unfavorable to the Bancorp.  
On June 30, 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of a 
majority interest in its processing business, Vantiv Holding, LLC. 

Advent International acquired an approximate 51% interest in 
Vantiv Holding, LLC for cash and a warrant. The Bancorp retained 
the remaining approximate 49% interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC.  
During the first quarter of 2012, Vantiv, Inc. priced an IPO of 
its shares and contributed the net proceeds to Vantiv Holding, LLC 
for additional ownership interests. As a result of this offering, the 
Bancorp™s ownership of Vantiv Holding, LLC was reduced to 
approximately 39%.  The impact of the capital contributions to 

Vantiv Holding, LLC and the resulting dilution in the Bancorp™s 

interest resulted in a gain of $115 million recognized by the Bancorp 
in the first quarter of 2012.  The following table provides a summary of the sales transactions that impacted the Bancorp's ownership interest in Vantiv Holdi

   (a)The Bancorp™s remaining investment in Vantiv Holding, LLC of 
$394
 as of 
December 31, 2014
 was accounted for as an equity method investment in the Bancorp™s Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 

A As of December 31, 2014, the Bancorp continued to hold 
approximately 43 million Class B units of Vantiv Holding, LLC and 

a warrant to purchase approximately 20.4 million Class C non-

voting units of Vantiv Holding, LLC, both of which may be 
exchanged for Class A Common Stock of Vantiv, Inc. on a one for 
one basis or at Vantiv, Inc.™s option for cash. In addition, the 

Bancorp holds approximately 43 million Class B common shares of 

Vantiv, Inc. The Class B common shares give the Bancorp voting 

rights, but no economic interest in Vantiv, Inc. The voting rights 

attributable to the Class B common shares are limited to 18.5% of 

the voting power in Vantiv, Inc. at any time other than in 

connection with a stockholder vote with respect to a change in 
control in Vantiv, Inc. These securities are subject to certain terms 
and restrictions. The Bancorp recognized $48 million, $77 million and $61 
million respectively, in noninterest income as part of its equity 

method investment in Vantiv Holding, LLC for the years ended 

December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and received cash distributions 

totaling $23 million, $40 million and $30 million during 2014, 2013 

and 2012, respectively. The Bancorp and Vantiv Holding, LLC have various 
agreements in place covering services relating to the operations of 

Vantiv Holding, LLC. The services provided by the Bancorp to 

Vantiv Holding, LLC were initially required to support Vantiv 
Holding, LLC as a standalone entity during the deconversion 
period. The majority of services previously provided by the Bancorp 

to support Vantiv Holding, Inc. as a standalone entity are no longer 

necessary and are now limited to certain general business resources. 

Vantiv Holding, LLC paid the Bancorp $1 million for these services 

for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, 

respectively. Other services provided to Vantiv Holding, LLC by the 

Bancorp, have continued beyond the deconversion period, include 
clearing, settlement and sponsorship. Vantiv Holding, LLC paid the 
Bancorp $44 million for these services for the year ended December 

31, 2014 and $34 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 
and 2012, respectively. In addition to the previously mentioned 
services, the Bancorp entered into an agreement under which Vantiv 

Holding, LLC will provide processing services to the Bancorp. The 

total amount of fees relating to the processing services provided to 

the Bancorp by Vantiv Holding, LLC totaled $83 million, $88

million and $83 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 
2013 and 2012, respectively.  
As part of the initial sale, Vantiv Holding, LLC assumed loans 
totaling $1.25 billion owed to the Bancorp, which were refinanced 

in 2010 into a larger syndicated loan structure that included the 

Bancorp. The outstanding balance of loans to Vantiv Holding, LLC 
was $204 million and $348 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, 
respectively. Interest income relating to the loans was $5 million, $7 
million and $11 million, respectively, for the years ended December 

31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and is included in interest and fees on 

loans and leases in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Vantiv 

Holding, LLC™s line of credit was $50 million as of December 31, 

2014 and 2013. Vantiv Holding, LLC did not draw upon its line of 

credit during the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013.

A The Bancorp™s unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2014, 
2013 and 2012 relate to state income tax exposures from taking tax 

positions where the Bancorp believes it is likely that, upon 
examination, a state will take a position contrary to the position 
taken by the Bancorp. 
While it is reasonably possible that the amount of the 
unrecognized tax benefits with respect to certain of the Bancorp™s 

uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease during the next 12 
months, the Bancorp believes it is unlikely that its unrecognized tax 
benefits will change by a material amount during the next 12 
months. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp had recorded 
deferred tax assets of $18 million and $22 million, respectively, 

related to state net operating loss carryforwards. The deferred tax 
assets relating to state net operating losses (primarily resulting from 
leasing operations) are presented net of specific valuation 
allowances of $19 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013. If these 
carryforwards are not utilized, they will expire in varying amounts 

through 2034.  
The Bancorp has determined that a valuation allowance is not 
needed against the remaining deferred tax assets as of December 31, 

2014 or 2013. The Bancorp considered all of the positive and 
negative evidence available to determine whether it is more likely 
than not that the deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized and, 
based upon that evidence, the Bancorp believes it is more likely than 

not that the deferred tax assets recorded at December 31, 2014 and 

2013 will ultimately be realized. The Bancorp reached this 

conclusion as the Bancorp has taxable income in the carryback 

period and it is expected that the Bancorp™s remaining deferred tax 
assets will be realized through the reversal of its existing taxable 
temporary differences and its projected future taxable income.  
The IRS is currently examining the Bancorp™s 2010 and 2011 
federal income tax returns. The statute of limitations for the 

Bancorp™s federal income tax returns remains open for tax years 
2010-2014. On occasion, as various state and local taxing 
jurisdictions examine the returns of the Bancorp and its subsidiaries, 

the Bancorp may agree to extend the statute of limitations for a 
short period of time. Otherwise, with the exception of a few states 
with insignificant uncertain tax positions, the statutes of limitations 
for state income tax returns remain open only for tax years in 

accordance with each state™s statutes. Any interest and penalties incurred in connection with income 
taxes are recorded as a component of income tax expense in the 

Consolidated Financial Statements. During the years ended 

December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Bancorp recognized an 
immaterial amount of interest expense in connection with income 
taxes. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp had accrued 
interest liabilities, net of the related tax benefits, of $1 million. No 

material liabilities were recorded for penalties related to income 

taxes. Retained earnings at December 31, 2014 and 2013 included 
$157 million in allocations of earnings for bad debt deductions of 

former thrift subsidiaries for which no income tax has been 
provided. Under current tax law, if certain of the Bancorp™s 
subsidiaries use these bad debt reserves for purposes other than to 

absorb bad debt losses, they will be subject to federal income tax at 
the current corporate tax rate. 
21. RETIREMENT AND BENEFIT PLANS The Bancorp™s qualified defined benefit plan™s benefits were frozen 
in 1998, except for grandfathered employees. The Bancorp™s other 

retirement plans consist of nonqualified, supplemental retirement 

plans, which are funded on an as needed basis. A majority of these 
plans were obtained in acquisitions from prior years. The Bancorp 
recognizes the overfunded and underfunded status of its pension 

plans as an asset and liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used 
for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general 

classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation 

hierarchy.  Equity securities
 The plan measures common stock using quoted prices which are 
available in an active market and classifies these investments within 

Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 
  Mutual and exchange traded funds 
All of the plan™s mutual and exchange traded funds are publicly 

traded. The plan measures the value of these investments using the 

fund™s quoted prices that are available in an active market and 
classifies these investments within Level 1 of the valuation 
hierarchy. Where quoted prices are not available, the plan measures 
the fair value of these investments based on the redemption price of 
units held, which is based on the current fair value of the fund™s 

underlying assets. Unit values are determined by dividing the fund™s 

net assets at fair value by its units outstanding at the valuation dates 

to obtain the investment™s net asset value. Therefore, these 

investments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Debt securities Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are 

classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities 

include U.S. Treasury obligations and federal agency securities. If 

quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated 

using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar 
characteristics, or DCFs. Examples of such instruments, which are 
classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include agency 

mortgage-backed securities, non-agency mortgage-backed securities 

and corporate bonds. 

    Plan Assumptions 
The plan assumptions are evaluated annually and are updated as 
necessary. The discount rate assumption reflects the yield on a 

portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments that have a 

similar duration to the plan™s liabilities. The expected long-term rate 

of return assumption reflects the average return expected on the 
assets invested to provide for the plan™s liabilities. In determining 
the expected long-term rate of return, the Bancorp evaluated 

actuarial and economic inputs, including long-term inflation rate 

assumptions and broad equity and bond indices long-term return 

projections, as well as actual long-term historical plan performance. 

In 2014, the Bancorp updated the mortality assumption which 
resulted in an increase of $14 million to the projected benefit 

obligation.                   The following table summarizes the weighted-average plan assumptions for the years ended December 31:
                       2014 
   2013 
 2012

  (a)Since the Bancorp™s qualified defined benefit plan™s benefits were frozen in 1998, except for grandfathered employees, the r
ate of compensation increase is no longer applicable beginning in 2014 since 
minimal grandfathered employees are still accruing benefits. 
Lowering both the expected rate of return on the plan assets and 
the discount rate by 0.25% would have increased the 2014 pension 

expense by approximately $1 million. 
Based on the actuarial assumptions, the Bancorp expects to 
contribute $4 million to the plan in 2015. Estimated pension benefit 

payments, which reflect expected future service, are $22 million in 

2015, $21 million in 2016, $19 million in 2017, $18 million in 2018 
and $16 million in 2019. The total estimated payments for the years 
2020 through 2024 is $80 million. Investment Policies and Strategies 
The Bancorp™s policy for the investment of plan assets is to employ 

investment strategies that achieve a range of weighted-average target 

asset allocations relating to equity securities (including the Bancorp™s 
common stock), fixed-income securities (including federal agency 
obligations, corporate bonds and notes), alternative strategies 

(including traditional mutual funds, precious metals and 
commodities) and cash.

The risk tolerance for the plan is determined by management to be 
ﬁmoderate to aggressiveﬂ, recognizing that higher returns involve 
some volatility and that periodic declines in the portfolio™s value are 
tolerated in an effort to achieve real capital growth. There were no 

significant concentrations of risk associated with the investments of 
the Bancorp™s benefit and retirement plan at December 31, 2014 
and 2013. Permitted asset classes of the plan include cash and cash 
equivalents, fixed-income (domestic and non-U.S. bonds), equities 

(U.S., non-U.S., emerging markets and REITS), equipment leasing, 
precious metals, commodity transactions and mortgages. The plan 
utilizes derivative instruments including puts, calls, straddles or 
other option strategies, as approved by management. Per ERISA, 
the Bancorp™s common stock cannot exceed 10% of the fair value 
of plan assets.   
Fifth Third Bank, as Trustee, is expected to manage the plan 
assets in a manner consistent with the plan agreement and other 

regulatory, federal and state laws. The Fifth Third Bank Pension, 
Profit Sharing and Medical Plan Committee (the ﬁCommitteeﬂ) is 

the plan administrator. The Trustee is required to provide to the 
Committee monthly and quarterly reports covering a list of plan 

assets, portfolio performance, transactions and asset allocation. The 
Trustee is also required to keep the Committee apprised of any

1/250th of a share of Series G convertible preferred stock and had a 

liquidation preference of $25,000 per preferred share of Series G 

stock. The preferred stock was convertible at any time, at the option 
of the shareholder, into 2,159.8272 shares of common stock, 
representing a conversion price of approximately $11.575 per share 

of common stock.  
On June 11, 2013, pursuant to the Amended Articles of 
Incorporation, the Bancorp™s Board of Directors authorized the 
conversion into common stock, no par value, of all outstanding 

shares of the Bancorp™s Series G perpetual preferred stock. The 
Articles grant the Bancorp the right, at its option, to convert all 
outstanding shares of Series G preferred stock if the closing price of 

common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price 

for 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days. 

The closing price of shares of common stock satisfied such 
threshold for the 30 trading days ended June 10, 2013, and the 
Bancorp gave the required notice of its exercise of its conversion 

right. On July 1, 2013, the Bancorp converted the remaining 16,442

4,110,500 depositary shares, into shares of Fifth Third™s common 

stock. Each share of Series G preferred stock was converted into 

2,159.8272 shares of common stock, representing a total of 
35,511,740 issued shares. The common shares issued in the 
conversion are exempt securities pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the

 Treasury Stock On March 13, 2012, the Bancorp announced the results of its capital 

plan submitted to the FRB as part of the 2012 CCAR. The FRB 

indicated to the Bancorp that it did not object to the repurchase of 

common shares in an amount equal to any after-tax gains realized by 

the Bancorp from the sale of Vantiv, Inc. common shares by either 

the Bancorp or Vantiv, Inc. On August 21, 2012, the Bancorp 

announced that the FRB did not object to its capital plan 

resubmitted under the 2012 CCAR process, which included the 
repurchases of common shares of up to $600 million through the 
first quarter of 2013, in addition to any incremental repurchase of 

common shares related to any after-tax gains realized by the 

Bancorp from the sale of Vantiv, Inc. common shares by either the 

Bancorp or Vantiv, Inc. As a result, on August 21, 2012, Fifth 

Third™s Board of Directors authorized the Bancorp to repurchase up 

to 100 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open 

market or in privately negotiated transactions, and to utilize any 
derivative or similar instrument to affect share repurchase 
transactions.  On March 14, 2013, the Bancorp announced the results of its 
capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of the 2013 CCAR. The 

FRB indicated to the Bancorp that it did not object to the potential 

repurchase of common shares in an amount up to $984 million, 

including any shares issued in a Series G preferred stock conversion, 

and the repurchase of common shares in an amount equal to any 
after-tax gains realized by the Bancorp from the sale of Vantiv, Inc. 
common stock. On March 19, 2013, the Board of Directors 
authorized the Bancorp to repurchase up to 100 million common 

shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, 

and to utilize any derivative or similar instrument to effect share 

repurchase transactions. This share repurchase authorization 

replaced the Board™s previous authorization from August of 2012. 
On March 18, 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the 
Bancorp to repurchase up to 100 million common shares in the 
open market or in privately negotiated transactions, and to utilize 

any derivative or similar instrument to effect share repurchase 
transactions. This share repurchase authorization replaced the 

Board™s previous authorization from March of 2013. 
On March 26, 2014, the Bancorp announced the results of its 
capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of the 2014 CCAR. The 
FRB indicated to the Bancorp that it did not object to the potential 
repurchase of $669 million of common shares with the additional 
ability to repurchase common shares in an amount equal to any 

after-tax gains realized by the Bancorp from the sale of Vantiv, Inc. 

common stock for the period beginning April 1, 2014 and ending 

March 31, 2015.   
The Bancorp entered into a number of accelerated share 
repurchase transactions during 2012, 2013 and 2014. As part of 
these transactions, the Bancorp entered into forward contracts in 
which the final number of shares delivered at settlement was based 
generally on a discount to the average daily volume weighted 

average price of the Bancorp™s common stock during the term of 

these repurchase agreements. The accelerated share repurchases 

were treated as two separate transactions (i) the acquisition of 

treasury shares on the acquisition date and (ii) a forward contract 
indexed to the Bancorp™s stock.   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

24. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
The Bancorp has historically emphasized employee stock 
ownership. The following table provides detail of the number of 

shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding stock-based awards 
and remaining shares available for future issuance under all of the 
Bancorp™s equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2014:

  (a)Under the 2014 Incentive Compensation Plan, 36 million shares of stock were authorized for issuance as incentive and nonqual
ified stock options, SARs, restricted stock and restricted stock units, 
performance units and performance RSAs. 
(b)The number of shares to be issued upon exercise will be determined at vesting based on the difference between the grant pric
e and the market price at the date of exercise. 
(c)Excludes 0.3 million outstanding options awarded under plans assumed by the Bancorp in connection with certain mergers and a
cquisitions. The Bancorp has not made any awards under these plans 
and will make no additional awards under these plans. The weighted
-average exercise price of the outstanding options is $13.76 
per share.  
 (d)Phantom stock units are settled in cash. 

(e)The number of shares to be issued is dependent upon the Bancorp achieving certain predefined performance targets and ranges 
from zero shares to approximately 2 million shares. 
(f)Represents remaining shares of Fifth Third common stock under the Bancorp™s 1993 Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restate
d, including an additional 1.5 million shares approved by 
shareholders on March 28, 2007 and an additional 12 million shares approved by shareholders on April 21, 2009. 
Stock-based awards are eligible for issuance under the Bancorp™s 
Incentive Compensation Plan to key employees and directors of the 

Bancorp and its subsidiaries. The Incentive Compensation Plan was 

approved by shareholders on April 15, 2014, and authorized the 
issuance of up to 36 million shares, including 16 million shares for 
Full Value Awards, as equity compensation and provides for 
incentive and nonqualified stock options, SARs, RSAs and restricted 
stock units, and performance shares. Full Value Awards are defined 

as awards with no cash outlay for the employee to obtain the full 

value. Based on total stock-based awards outstanding (including 

stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and 

performance units) and shares remaining for future grants under the 
2014 Incentive Compensation Plan, the potential dilution to which 
the Bancorp™s shareholders of common stock are exposed due to 
the potential that stock-based compensation will be awarded to 
executives, directors or key employees of the Bancorp is 10%. 

SARs, restricted stock, stock options and performance units 

outstanding represent seven percent of the Bancorp™s issued shares 

at December 31, 2014. All of the Bancorp™s stock-based awards are to be settled with 
stock. The Bancorp has historically used treasury stock to settle 

stock-based awards, when available. SARs, issued at fair value based 

on the closing price of the Bancorp™s common stock on the date of 
grant, have up to ten-year terms and vest and become exercisable 
either ratably or fully over a four year period of continued 

employment. The Bancorp does not grant discounted SARs or stock 
options, re-price previously granted SARs or stock options, or grant 
reload stock options. Restricted stock award grants vest after four 

years, or ratably over three or four years of continued employment 

and include dividend and voting rights. Stock options were 

previously issued at fair value based on the closing price of the 
Bancorp™s common stock on the date of grant, have up to ten-year 
terms and vested and became fully exercisable ratably over a three 

or four year period of continued employment. Performance unit 
awards have three-year cliff vesting terms with market conditions as 
defined by the plan. All of the Bancorp™s executive stock-based 

awards contain an annual performance hurdle of two percent return 

on tangible common equity. If this threshold is not met all awards 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  148  Fifth Third Bancorp 
that would vest in the next year are forfeited. The Bancorp met this 
threshold as of December 31, 2014.  
Stock-based compensation expense was $83 million, $78 
million and $69 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 
2013 and 2012, respectively, and is included in salaries, wages, and 
incentives in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total 
related income tax benefit recognized was $30 million, $28 million 
and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 
2012, respectively.  
 Stock Appreciation Rights 
The Bancorp uses assumptions, which are evaluated and revised as 

necessary, in estimating the grant-date fair value of each SAR grant.
  The weighted-average assumptions were as follows for the years ended December 31:
                  2014     
2013     
2012     
Expected life (in years)  
6   6   6   Expected volatility  
35% 
 36%
 37% 
 Expected dividend yield  
2.4% 
 3.0%
  2.8% 
 Risk-free interest rate 
2.0% 
 1.0%
  1.2% 
               The expected life is generally derived from historical exercise 
patterns and represents the amount of time that SARs granted are 

expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility is based on a 
combination of historical and implied volatilities of the Bancorp™s 
common stock. The expected dividend yield is based on annual 
dividends divided by the Bancorp™s stock price. Annual dividends 
are based on projected dividends, estimated using an expected long-

term dividend payout ratio, over the estimated life of the awards. 

The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of 

the SARs is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the 

time of grant.   
The grant-date fair value of SARs is measured using the Black-
Scholes option-pricing model.
 The weighted-average grant-date fair 
value of SARs granted was $6.53, $4.56 and $4.23 per share for the 
years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The total grant-date 
fair value of SARs that vested during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $34 
million, $29 million, and $22 million, respectively.   
At December 31, 2014, there was $57 million of stock-based 
compensation expense related to nonvested SARs not yet 

recognized. The expense is expected to be recognized over a 

remaining weighted-average period of approximately 2.4 years.

  150  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Other stock-based compensation  
The Bancorp™s Board of Directors previously approved the use of 
phantom stock units as part of its compensation for executives in 

connection with changes made in reaction to the TARP 
compensation rules. On February 22, 2011, the Bancorp redeemed 
its Series F preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury under the 
CPP. As a result of this redemption, the last payment of phantom 
stock occurred in April of 2011. The phantom stock units were 

issued under the Bancorp™s 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan. The 

number of phantom stock units was determined each pay period by 

dividing the amount of salary to be paid in phantom stock units for 

that pay period, by the reported closing price of the Bancorp™s 
common stock on the pay date for such pay period. The phantom 
stock units vested immediately on issuance. Phantom stock was 
expensed based on the number of outstanding units multiplied by 

the closing price of the Bancorp™s stock at period end. The phantom 

stock units did not include any rights to receive dividends or 

dividend equivalents. Phantom stock units issued on or before June 

12, 2010 were settled in cash upon the earlier to occur of June 15, 
2011 or the executive™s death. Units issued thereafter were settled in 
cash with 50% settled on June 15, 2012 and 50% settled on June 15, 
2013. The amount paid on settlement of the phantom stock units 
was equal to the total amount of phantom stock units settled at the 

reported closing price of the Bancorp™s common stock on the 

settlement date. Under the phantom stock program, no phantom 

stock units were granted during the years ended December 31, 2014, 

2013 and 2012. No phantom stock units were settled during the year 
ended December 31, 2014 and 200,130 and 199,813 phantom stock 
units were settled during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 
2012, respectively.  
Performance units are payable contingent upon the Bancorp 
achieving certain predefined performance targets over the three-year 

measurement period. Awards granted during 2014, 2013 and 2012 

will be entirely settled in stock. The performance targets are based 
on the Bancorp™s performance relative to a defined peer group. 
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, 322,567, 348,595, and 344,741 
performance units, respectively, were granted by the Bancorp. These 
awards were granted at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of 

$15.61, $16.15 and $14.36 per unit during 2014, 2013 and 2012, 

respectively.  The Bancorp sponsors a stock purchase plan that allows 
qualifying employees to purchase shares of the Bancorp™s common 
stock with a 15% match. During the years ended December 31, 

2014, 2013 and 2012, there were 599,101, 690,039 and 827,709 
shares, respectively, purchased by participants and the Bancorp 
recognized stock-based compensation expense of $1 million in each 

of the respective years.

Shares are excluded from the computation of net income per diluted 
share when their inclusion has an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per 
share. The diluted earnings per share computation for 2014, 2013 
and 2012 excludes 13 million, 24 million, and 36 million, 

respectively, of SARs and an immaterial amount, 1 million, and 5 

million, respectively, of stock options because their inclusion would 

have been anti-dilutive.  The diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended 
December 31, 2014 excludes the impact of the forward contract 

related to the October 23, 2014 accelerated share repurchase 
transaction. Based on the average daily volume-weighted average 
price of the Bancorp™s common stock during the fourth quarter of 
2014, the counterparty to the transaction would have been required 
to deliver additional shares for the settlement of the forward 

contract as of December 31, 2014, and thus the impact of the 

accelerated share repurchase transaction would have been anti-

dilutive to earnings per share.  
The diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended 
December 31, 2013 excludes the impact of the forward contracts 
related to the November 18, 2013 and December 13, 2013 
accelerated share repurchase transactions. Based upon the average 
daily volume-weighted average price of the Bancorp™s common 

stock during the fourth quarter of 2013, the counterparty to the 

transactions would have been required to deliver additional shares 

for the settlement of the forward contracts as of December 31, 

2013, and thus the impact of the two accelerated share repurchase 
transactions would have been anti-dilutive to earnings per share.  
The diluted earnings per share computation for the year ended 
December 31, 2012 excludes the impact of the forward contracts 

related to the November 6, 2012 and December 14, 2012 

accelerated share repurchase transactions. Based upon the average 

daily volume-weighted average price of the Bancorp™s common 

stock during the fourth quarter of 2012, the counterparty to the 
transactions would have been required to deliver additional shares 
for the settlement of the forward contracts as of December 31, 
2012, and thus the impact of the two accelerated share repurchase 
transactions would have been anti-dilutive to earnings per share.

27. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair 
value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the 

price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 

liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. U.S. GAAP also establishes a fair value 
hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used 
to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value 
hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest 

priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A financial instrument™s 

categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the 
lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument™s fair value 
measurement. For more information regarding the fair value 

hierarchy and how the Bancorp measures fair value, refer to Note 1.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used 
for significant instruments measured at fair value, as well as the 
general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation 

hierarchy.  
 
Available-for-sale and other and trading securities 
Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are 
classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities 

include government bonds and exchange traded equities. If quoted 
market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using 
pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar 

characteristics, or DCFs. Examples of such instruments, which are 

classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include federal 

agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, agency 
residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and non-agency 
commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities 

and other debt securities. Corporate bonds are included in asset-
backed securities and other debt securities in the previous table. 
Federal agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, 
agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and non-
agency commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed 
securities and other debt securities are generally valued using a 

market approach based on observable prices of securities with 

similar characteristics. 
 
Residential mortgage loans held for sale  

For residential mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value 

election has been made, fair value is estimated based upon 
mortgage-backed securities prices and spreads to those prices or, for 
certain ARM loans, DCF models that may incorporate the 

anticipated portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-backed 

securities with similar collateral and market conditions. The 

anticipated portfolio composition includes the effect of interest rate 

spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as the 
state in which the loan was originated, the loan amount and the 
ARM margin. Residential mortgage loans held for sale that are 
valued based on mortgage-backed securities prices are classified 
within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as the valuation is based on 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 155  Fifth Third Bancorp 
external pricing for similar instruments. ARM loans classified as 
held for sale are also classified within Level 2 of the valuation 

hierarchy due to the use of observable inputs in the DCF model. 

These observable inputs include interest rate spreads from agency 

mortgage-backed securities market rates and observable discount 

rates.   Residential mortgage loans 
Residential mortgage loans held for sale that are reclassified to held 

for investment are transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 of the fair 

value hierarchy. It is the Bancorp™s policy to value any transfers 

between levels of the fair value hierarchy based on end of period 

fair values.  For residential mortgage loans reclassified from held for sale to 
held for investment, the fair value estimation is based on mortgage-
backed securities prices, interest rate risk and an internally 

developed credit component. Therefore, these loans are classified 

within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. An adverse change in the 

loss rate or severity assumption would result in a decrease in fair 
value of the related loan. The Secondary Marketing Department, 
which reports to the Bancorp™s Chief Operating Officer, in 

conjunction with the Consumer Credit Risk Department, which 
reports to the Bancorp™s Chief Risk Officer, are responsible for 
determining the valuation methodology for residential mortgage 

loans held for investment. The Secondary Marketing Department 

reviews loss severity assumptions quarterly to determine if 

adjustments are necessary based on decreases in observable housing 

market data. This group also reviews trades in comparable 

benchmark securities and adjusts the values of loans as necessary. 

Consumer Credit Risk is responsible for the credit component of 
the fair value which is based on internally developed loss rate 
models that take into account historical loss rates and loss severities 

based on underlying collateral values. 
 Derivatives 

Exchange-traded derivatives valued using quoted prices and certain 

over-the-counter derivatives valued using active bids are classified 

within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Most of the Bancorp™s
derivative contracts are valued using DCF or other models that 
incorporate current market interest rates, credit spreads assigned to 

the derivative counterparties and other market parameters and, 

therefore, are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 

Such derivatives include basic and structured interest rate, foreign 

exchange and commodity swaps and options. Derivatives that are 

valued based upon models with significant unobservable market 

parameters are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
At December 31, 2014 and 2013, derivatives classified as Level 3, 
which are valued using models containing unobservable inputs, 
consisted primarily of a warrant associated with the initial sale of the 
Bancorp™s 51% interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC to Advent 

International and a total return swap associated with the Bancorp™s 

sale of Visa, Inc. Class B shares. Level 3 derivatives also include 

IRLCs, which utilize internally generated loan closing rate 

assumptions as a significant unobservable input in the valuation 
process.  
The warrant allows the Bancorp to purchase approximately 20 
million incremental nonvoting units in Vantiv Holding, LLC at an 
exercise price of $15.98 per unit and requires settlement under 

certain defined conditions involving change of control. The fair 

value of the warrant is calculated in conjunction with a third party 

valuation provider by applying Black-Scholes option valuation 
models using probability weighted scenarios which contain the 
following inputs: Vantiv, Inc. stock price, strike price per the 

Warrant Agreement and several unobservable inputs, such as 

expected term, expected volatility, and expected dividend rate.  
For the warrant, an increase in the expected term (years) and 
the expected volatility assumptions would result in an increase in the 
fair value; conversely, a decrease in these assumptions would result 
in a decrease in the fair value. The Accounting and Treasury 
Departments, both of which report to the Bancorp™s Chief Financial 

Officer, determined the valuation methodology for the warrant. 

Accounting and Treasury review changes in fair value on a quarterly 

basis for reasonableness based on changes in historical and implied 

volatilities, expected terms, probability weightings of the related 
scenarios, and other assumptions. 
Under the terms of the total return swap, the Bancorp will 
make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the 

conversion rate of the Visa, Inc. Class B shares into Class A shares. 

Additionally, the Bancorp will make a quarterly payment based on 

Visa™s stock price and the conversion rate of the Visa, Inc. Class B 

shares into Class A shares until the date on which the Covered 
Litigation is settled. The fair value of the total return swap was 
calculated using a DCF model based on unobservable inputs 
consisting of management™s estimate of the probability of certain 
litigation scenarios, the timing of the resolution of the Covered 

Litigation and Visa litigation loss estimates in excess, or shortfall, of 

the Bancorp™s proportional share of escrow funds. 
An increase in the loss estimate or a delay in the resolution of 
the Covered Litigation would result in an increase in fair value; 

conversely, a decrease in the loss estimate or an acceleration of the 
resolution of the Covered Litigation would result in a decrease in 
fair value. The Accounting and Treasury Departments determined 
the valuation methodology for the total return swap. Accounting 
and Treasury review the changes in fair value on a quarterly basis 
for reasonableness based on Visa stock price changes, litigation 

contingencies, and escrow funding. The net fair value asset of the IRLCs at December 31, 2014 
was $12 million. Immediate decreases in current interest rates of 25 

bps and 50 bps would result in increases in the fair value of the 
IRLCs of approximately $5 million and $9 million, respectively. 
Immediate increases of current interest rates of 25 bps and 50 bps 

would result in decreases in the fair value of the IRLCs of 

approximately $5 million and $11 million, respectively. The decrease 

in fair value of IRLCs due to immediate 10% and 20% adverse 
changes in the assumed loan closing rates would be approximately 

$1 million and $2 million, respectively, and the increase in fair value 

due to immediate 10% and 20% favorable changes in the assumed 
loan closing rates would be approximately $1 million and $2 million, 
respectively. These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used 

with caution, as changes in fair value based on a variation in 

assumptions typically cannot be extrapolated because the 

relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value 
may not be linear.  
The Secondary Marketing Department and the Consumer Line 
of Business Finance Department, which reports to the Bancorp™s 
Chief Financial Officer, are responsible for determining the 
valuation methodology for IRLCs. Secondary Marketing, in 

conjunction with a third party valuation provider, periodically 

review loan closing rate assumptions and recent loan sales to 
determine if adjustments are needed for current market conditions 
not reflected in historical data.

 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a 
Nonrecurring Basis 
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a 

nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are not measured at 
fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to fair 
value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is 
evidence of impairment.

(a)Includes funds the Bancorp will be prohibited from retaining after the July 21, 2016 end of the conformance period for the f
inal rules, adopted under the BHCA, that implemented the provision of the 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule.  
Commercial loans held for sale 
During 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp transferred $28 million and $5 

million, respectively, of commercial loans from the portfolio to 

loans held for sale that upon transfer were measured at lower of 
cost or fair value. These loans had fair value adjustments in 2014 
and 2013 totaling $10 million and $4 million, respectively, and were 
generally based on appraisals of the underlying collateral and were 
therefore, classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 

Additionally, during 2014 and 2013 there were fair value 

adjustments on existing commercial loans held for sale of $2 million 

and $3 million, respectively. The fair value adjustments were also 
based on appraisals of the underlying collateral and were therefore 
classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.An adverse 
change in the fair value of the underlying collateral would result in a 
decrease in the fair value measurement.  

        The Accounting Department determines the procedures for 

valuation of commercial HFS loans which may include a 

comparison to recently executed transactions of similar type loans. 

A monthly review of the portfolio is performed for reasonableness. 
Quarterly, appraisals approaching a year old are updated and the 
Real Estate Valuation group, which reports to the Chief Risk 
Officer, in conjunction with the Commercial Line of Business 
review the third party appraisals for reasonableness. Additionally, 

the Commercial Line of Business Finance Department, which 

reports to the Bancorp Chief Financial Officer, in conjunction with 

Accounting review all loan appraisal values, carrying values and 
vintages.  
Residential mortgage loans held for sale 
During 2014, the Bancorp transferred $720 million of restructured 
residential mortgage loans from the portfolio to loans held for sale 

that upon transfer were measured at lower of cost or fair value using 

significant unobservable inputs. These loans had fair value 

adjustments in 2014 totaling $87 million. The fair value adjustments 
were based on estimated third-party valuations utilizing recent sales 
data from similar transactions. Broker opinion statements were also 

obtained as additional evidence to support the third-party 
valuations. The Treasury Department worked with the third-party 
advisor to estimate the fair value adjustments. The discounts taken 

were intended to represent the perspective of a market participant, 

considering among other things, required investor returns which 

include liquidity discounts reflected in similar bulk transactions. An 

adverse change in the fair value of the underlying collateral would 

result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. 
 Commercial loans held for investment  

During 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring 

impairment adjustments to certain commercial and industrial, 

commercial mortgage and commercial construction loans held for 
investment. Larger commercial loans included within aggregate 
borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit 
probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual 
review for impairment. The Bancorp considers the current value of 

collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantor™s liquidity 

and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors 

when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. When the 
loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of the loan is generally 
based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the 
loan and therefore these loans were classified within Level 3 of the 
valuation hierarchy. In cases where the carrying value exceeds the 

fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.  
An adverse change in the fair value of the underlying collateral 
would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement.   The fair 

values and recognized impairment losses are reflected in the 
previous table. Commercial Credit Risk, which reports to the Chief 
Risk Officer, is responsible for preparing and reviewing the fair 
value estimates for commercial loans held  for investment. 

           

MSRs 

Mortgage interest rates decreased during the year ended December 

31, 2014 and the Bancorp recognized temporary impairment in 
certain classes of the MSR portfolio and the carrying value was 
adjusted to the fair value. The Bancorp recognized a recovery of 
temporary impairment on servicing rights during the year ended 
December 31, 2013. MSRs do not trade in an active, open market 

with readily observable prices. While sales of MSRs do occur, the 

precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. 

Accordingly, the Bancorp estimates the fair value of MSRs using 

internal DCF models with certain unobservable inputs, primarily 
prepayment speed assumptions, discount rates and weighted average 
lives, resulting in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation 
hierarchy. Refer to Note 11 for further information on the 
assumptions used in the valuation of the Bancorp™s MSRs. The 

Secondary Marketing Department and Treasury Department are 

responsible for determining the valuation methodology for MSRs. 

Representatives from Secondary Marketing, Treasury, Accounting 

and Risk Management are responsible for reviewing key 
assumptions used in the internal DCF model. Two external 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  160  Fifth Third Bancorp 
valuations of the MSR portfolio are obtained from third parties that 
use valuation models in order to assess the reasonableness of the 

internal DCF model. Additionally, the Bancorp participates in peer 

surveys that provide additional confirmation of the reasonableness 
of key assumptions utilized in the MSR valuation process and the 
resulting MSR prices.  
OREO 
During 2014 and 2013, the Bancorp recorded nonrecurring 

adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate 

properties classified as OREO and measured at the lower of 

carrying amount or fair value. These nonrecurring losses are 
primarily due to declines in real estate values of the properties 
recorded in OREO. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 
2013, these losses include $12 million and $19 million, respectively, 

recorded as charge-offs, on new OREO properties transferred from 

loans during the respective periods and $14 million and $26 million, 

respectively, recorded as negative fair value adjustments on OREO 
in other noninterest income subsequent to their transfer from loans. 
As discussed in the following paragraphs, the fair value amounts are 
generally based on appraisals of the property values, resulting in a 
classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. In cases 

where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, 

an impairment loss is recognized. The previous tables reflect the fair 

value measurements of the properties before deducting the 

estimated costs to sell. 
The Real Estate Valuation department, which reports to the 
Chief Risk Officer, is solely responsible for managing the appraisal 
process and evaluating the appraisal for all commercial properties 
transferred to OREO. All appraisals on commercial OREO 

properties are updated on at least an annual basis. The Real Estate Valuation department reviews the BPO data 
and internal market information to determine the initial charge-off 
on residential real estate loans transferred to OREO. Once the 
foreclosure process is completed, the Bancorp performs an interior 

inspection to update the initial fair value of the property. These 
properties are reviewed at least every 30 days after the initial interior 
inspections are completed. The Asset Manager receives a monthly 

status report for each property which includes the number of 

showings, recently sold properties, current comparable listings and 
overall market conditions.  Bank Premises 

The Bancorp monitors consumer preferences for banking 
interactions and related customer behavior patterns in an effort to 
ensure that its retail distribution network is both responsive to such 

trends and efficient. As part of this ongoing assessment, the 

Bancorp determined that certain components of its Bank Premises 

would no longer be held for or used for their intended purposes and 

therefore these properties were written down to their lower of cost 

or market value. At least annually thereafter, the Bancorp will review 

these properties for market fluctuations. The fair value amounts 
were generally based on appraisals of the property values, resulting 
in a classification within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. For 

further information, refer to Note 7.  
Private equity investment funds The Volcker Rule, was approved by the respective federal agencies 

on December 10, 2013 and prohibits the Bancorp from retaining an 

interest in certain of its private equity fund investments. Therefore, 
while the Bancorp has not approved a formal plan to sell any of the 
private equity funds, the Bancorp has determined that it may be 

forced to sell certain of these funds prior to their scheduled 

redemption dates to comply with the Volcker Rule conformance 

period. As a result, the Bancorp has performed nonrecurring fair 

value measurements on a fund by fund basis to determine whether 

OTTI exists. The Bancorp estimated the fair value of a fund by 

using the net asset value reported by the fund manager, and in some 
cases, applying an estimated market discount to the reported net 
asset value of the fund. Because the length of time until the 

investment will become redeemable is generally not certain, these 

funds were classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The 

Bancorp recognized $4 million of OTTI on its investments in 

private equity funds during 2013. The Bancorp recognized no OTTI 

on its investments in private equity funds during 2014. An adverse 

change in the reported net asset values or estimated market 
discounts where applicable, would result in a decrease in the fair 
value estimate. In cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair 
value, an impairment loss is recognized. The Bancorp™s private 

equity department, which reports to the Chief Operating Officer, in 

conjunction with Accounting, is responsible for preparing and 

reviewing the fair value estimates.  

 Fair Value Option 
The Bancorp elected to measure certain residential mortgage loans 

held for sale under the fair value option as allowed under U.S. 

GAAP. Electing to measure residential mortgage loans held for sale 
at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches 

changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of 
derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. Management™s 

intent to sell residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale 

may change over time due to such factors as changes in the overall 
liquidity in markets or changes in characteristics specific to certain 
loans held for sale. Consequently, these loans may be reclassified to 

loans held for investment and maintained in the Bancorp™s loan 
portfolio. In such cases, the loans will continue to be measured at 
fair value.  
Fair value changes recognized in earnings for instruments held 
at December 31, 2014 and 2013 for which the fair value option was 

elected as well as the changes in fair value of the underlying IRLCs, 
included gains of $26 million and $20 million, respectively. These 
gains are reported in mortgage banking net revenue in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income.  
Valuation adjustments related to instrument-specific credit risk 
for residential mortgage loans measured at fair value negatively 

impacted the fair value of those loans by $2 million at both 

December 31, 2014 and 2013. Interest on residential mortgage loans 

measured at fair value is accrued as it is earned using the effective 
interest method and is reported as interest income in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income.

prevailing market rates and limited credit risk, carrying amounts 

approximate fair value. Those financial instruments include cash and 
due from banks, FHLB and FRB restricted stock, other short-term 
investments, certain deposits (demand, interest checking, savings, 
money market and foreign office deposits), federal funds purchased, 
and other short-term borrowings excluding FHLB borrowings. Fair 
values for other time deposits, certificates of deposit $100,000 and 

over and FHLB borrowings were estimated using a DCF calculation 

that applies prevailing LIBOR/swap interest rates and a spread for 

new issuances with similar terms.    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 163  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Held-to-maturity securities 
The Bancorp™s held-to-maturity securities are primarily composed of 

instruments that provide income tax credits as the economic return 

on the investment. The fair value of these instruments is estimated 

based on current U.S. Treasury tax credit rates. 

 Loans held for sale 
Fair values for commercial loans held for sale were valued based on 

executable bids when available, or on DCF models incorporating 

appraisals of the underlying collateral, as well as assumptions about 

investor return requirements and amounts and timing of expected 

cash flows. Fair values for residential mortgage loans held for sale 

were valued based on estimated third-party valuations utilizing 

recent sales data from similar transactions. Broker opinion 
statements were also obtained as additional evidence to support the 
third-party valuations. Fair values for other consumer loans held for 

sale were based on contractual values upon which the loans may be 

sold to a third party, and approximate their carrying value. 

 Portfolio loans and leases, net 
Fair values were estimated by discounting future cash flows using 

the current market rates of loans to borrowers with similar credit 
characteristics, similar remaining maturities, prepayment speeds and 
loss severities. 
 
Long-term debt 
Fair value of long-term debt was based on quoted market prices, 

when available, or a DCF calculation using LIBOR/swap interest 

rates and, in some cases, Fifth Third credit and/or debt instrument 

spreads for new issuances with similar terms.

28. CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL RATIOS 
The principal source of income and funds for the Bancorp (parent 
company) are dividends from its subsidiaries. The dividends paid by 
the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary are subject to regulations and 
limitations prescribed by the appropriate state and federal 

supervisory authorities. The Bancorp™s nonbank subsidiaries are also 
limited by certain federal and state statutory provisions and 
regulations covering the amount of dividends that may be paid in 

any given year. The Bancorp™s banking subsidiary must maintain cash reserve 
balances when total reservable deposit liabilities are greater than the 
regulatory exemption. These reserve requirements may be satisfied 
with vault cash and balances on deposit with the FRB. In 2014 and 
2013, the banking subsidiary was required to maintain average cash 
reserve balances of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. 
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued 
capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the 

adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a BHC and in 

analyzing applications to it under the BHCA of 1956, as amended. 
These guidelines include quantitative measures that assign risk 
weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items, as well as define 

and set minimum regulatory capital requirements. All bank holding 

companies are required to maintain Tier I capital (core capital) of at 

least four percent of risk-weighted assets (Tier I risk-based capital 

ratio), total capital (Tier I plus Tier II capital) of at least eight 

percent of risk-weighted assets (Total risk-based capital ratio), and 

Tier I capital of at least three percent of adjusted quarterly average 
assets (Tier I leverage ratio). Failure to meet the minimum capital 
requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could 
have a direct material effect on the Consolidated Financial 

Statements of the Bancorp.   
Tier I capital consists principally of shareholders™ equity 
including Tier I qualifying TruPS. It excludes unrealized gains and 

losses on available-for-sale securities and unrecognized pension 
actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost, goodwill, certain 
other intangibles and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow 
hedges. The revised regulatory capital rules known as Basel III will 

phase out the inclusion of certain TruPS as a component of Tier I 

capital when the rules become effective for the Bancorp beginning 
January 1, 2015. Under these provisions, these TruPS would qualify 
as a component of Tier II capital. At December 31, 2014, the 
Bancorp™s Tier I capital included $60 million of TruPS representing 
approximately 5 bps of risk-weighted assets. Tier II capital consists 

principally of term subordinated debt and, subject to limitations, 
allowances for credit losses.  
Assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet 
items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories, according 

to the obligor, guarantor or nature of collateral. The aggregate dollar 

value of the amount of each category is multiplied by the associated 
risk weighting of that category. The resulting weighted values from 
each of the risk categories in sum is the total risk-weighted assets. 

Quarterly average assets for this purpose do not include goodwill 
and any other intangible assets and other investments that the FRB 
determines should be deducted from Tier I capital.   
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued 
capital adequacy guidelines for banking subsidiaries substantially 

similar to those adopted for bank holding companies, as described 
previously. In addition, the federal banking agencies have issued 
substantially similar regulations to implement the system of prompt 

corrective action established by Section 38 of the FDIA. Under the 

regulations, a bank generally shall be deemed to be well-capitalized 

if it has a Total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, a Tier I risk-

based capital ratio of six percent or more, a Tier I leverage ratio of 

five percent or more and is not subject to any written capital order 

or directive. If an institution becomes undercapitalized, it would 
become subject to significant additional oversight, regulations and 
requirements as mandated by the FDIA.  
The Bancorp and its banking subsidiary, Fifth Third Bank, had Tier I risk-based capital, Total risk-based capital and Tier I leverage 

ratios above the well-capitalized levels at December 31, 2014 and 

2013. As of December 31, 2014, the most recent notification from 

the FRB categorized the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary as well-
capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective 
action. To continue to qualify for financial holding company status 
pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the Bancorp™s 
banking subsidiary must, among other things, maintain ﬁwell-

capitalizedﬂ capital ratios.  The following table presents capital and risk-based capital and leverage ratios for the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary at D

30. BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial 
Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Investment 

Advisors. Results of the Bancorp™s business segments are presented 

based on its management structure and management accounting 
practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the 
Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp™s business 
segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information 

for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its 

methodologies from time to time as management™s accounting 

practices and businesses change. 
The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the 
corporate level by employing an FTP methodology. This 
methodology insulates the business segments from interest rate 
volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through loan 
originations and deposit taking. The FTP system assigns charge 

rates and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, 

based on expected duration and the U.S. swap curve. Matching 

duration allocates interest income and interest expense to each 
segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from 
interest rate risk. In a rising rate environment, the Bancorp benefits 
from the widening spread between deposit costs and wholesale 
funding costs. However, the Bancorp™s FTP system credits this 

benefit to deposit-providing businesses, such as Branch Banking 

and Investment Advisors, on a duration-adjusted basis. The net 

impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate 

and Other. The Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as 
dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning 
assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of the 
estimated durations for the indeterminate-lived deposits. The credit 

rate provided for demand deposit accounts is reviewed annually 

based upon the account type, its estimated duration and the 

corresponding fed funds, U.S. swap curve or swap rate. The credit 
rates for several deposit products were reset January 1, 2014 to 
reflect the current market rates and updated market assumptions. 

These rates were generally higher than those in place during 2013, 
thus net interest income for deposit providing businesses was 
positively impacted during 2014.  The business segments are charged provision expense based on 
the actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases 
owned by each segment. Provision expense attributable to loan and 

lease growth and changes in ALLL factors are captured in General 
Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments 

include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. 
Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking 
advantage of cross-sell opportunities and when funding operations, 

by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.  
The results of operations and financial position for the years 
ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were adjusted to reflect the 
transfer of certain customers and Bancorp employees from Branch 

Banking to Commercial Banking, effective January 1, 2014. In 

addition, the 2013 and 2012 balances were adjusted to reflect a 
change in internal allocation methodology. 
The following is a description of each of the Bancorp™s 
business segments, and the products and services they provide to 

their respective client bases. 
Commercial Banking
 offers credit intermediation, cash 
management and financial services to large and middle-market 

businesses and government and professional customers. In addition 

to the traditional lending and depository offerings, Commercial 
Banking products and services include global cash management, 
foreign exchange and international trade finance, derivatives and 
capital markets services, asset-based lending, real estate finance, 
public finance, commercial leasing and syndicated finance.  
Branch Banking
 provides a full range of deposit and loan and 
lease products to individuals and small businesses through 1,302 
full-service Banking Centers. Branch Banking offers depository and 
loan products, such as checking and savings accounts, home equity 

loans and lines of credit, credit cards and loans for automobiles and 

other personal financing needs, as well as products designed to meet 

the specific needs of small businesses, including cash management 

services.  Consumer Lending
 includes the Bancorp™s mortgage, home 
equity, automobile and other indirect lending activities. Direct 
lending activities include the origination, retention and servicing of 
mortgage and home equity loans or lines of credit, sales and 
securitizations of those loans, pools of loans or lines of credit, and 
all associated hedging activities. Indirect lending activities include 

extending loans to consumers through correspondent lenders and 

automobile dealers.  
Investment Advisors
 provides a full range of investment 
alternatives for individuals, companies and not-for-profit 
organizations. Investment Advisors is made up of four main 
businesses: FTS, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the 
Bancorp; ClearArc Capital, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned 

subsidiary of the Bancorp; Fifth Third Private Bank; and Fifth Third 

Institutional Services. FTS offers full service retail brokerage 

services to individual clients and broker dealer services to the 

institutional marketplace. ClearArc Capital, Inc. provides asset 
management services and previously advised the Bancorp™s 
proprietary family of mutual funds. Fifth Third Private Bank offers 
holistic strategies to affluent clients in wealth planning, investing, 
insurance and wealth protection. Fifth Third Institutional Services 

provides advisory services for institutional clients including states 

and municipalities.

PART I 
ITEM 1.BUSINESS 

General Information 
The Bancorp, an Ohio corporation organized in 1975, is a bank 
holding company (ﬁBHCﬂ) as defined by the Bank Holding 

Company Act of 1956, as amended (the ﬁBHCAﬂ), and is 

registered as such with the Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System (the ﬁFRBﬂ). The Bancorp™s principal office is 

located in Cincinnati, Ohio.  
The Bancorp™s subsidiaries provide a wide range of financial 
products and services to the retail, commercial, financial, 
governmental, educational and medical sectors, including a wide 
variety of checking, savings and money market accounts, and 

credit products such as credit cards, installment loans, mortgage 
loans and leases. Fifth Third Bank has deposit insurance provided 
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the ﬁFDICﬂ) 

through the Deposit Insurance Fund. Refer to Exhibit 21 filed as 

an attachment to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of 

subsidiaries of the Bancorp as of December 31, 2014.  
The Bancorp derives the majority of its revenues from the 
U.S. Revenue from foreign countries and external customers 

domiciled in foreign countries is immaterial to the Bancorp™s 

Consolidated Financial Statements.  
Additional information regarding the Bancorp™s businesses is 
included in Management™s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 

Condition and Results of Operations.  
CompetitionThe Bancorp competes for deposits, loans and other banking 
services in its principal geographic markets as well as in selected 
national markets as opportunities arise. In addition to the 

challenge of attracting and retaining customers for traditional 

banking services, the Bancorp™s competitors include securities 

dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and 

insurance companies. These competitors, with focused products 

targeted at highly profitable customer segments, compete across 

geographic boundaries and provide customers increasing access 

to meaningful alternatives to banking services in nearly all 

significant products. The increasingly competitive environment is 

a result primarily of changes in regulation, changes in technology, 

product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of 

consolidation among financial service providers. These 

competitive trends are likely to continue.  
Acquisitions 
The Bancorp™s strategy for growth includes strengthening its 
presence in core markets, expanding into contiguous markets and 

broadening its product offerings while taking into account the 

integration and other risks of growth. The Bancorp evaluates 

strategic acquisition opportunities and conducts due diligence 

activities in connection with possible transactions. As a result, 

discussions, and in some cases, negotiations may take place and 

future acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may 

occur. These typically involve the payment of a premium over 

book value and current market price, and therefore, some dilution 

of book value and net income per share may occur with any 

future transactions.  
Regulation and Supervision 
In addition to the generally applicable state and federal laws 
governing businesses and employers, the Bancorp and its banking 
subsidiary are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state 
laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their 

parent companies. Virtually all aspects of the business of the 
 173  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Bancorp and its banking subsidiary are subject to specific 
requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight. The 

principal objectives of state and federal banking laws and 

regulations and the supervision, regulation and examination of 

banks and their parent companies (such as the Bancorp) by bank 

regulatory agencies are the maintenance of the safety and 

soundness of financial institutions, maintenance of the federal 

deposit insurance system and the protection of consumers or 

classes of consumers, rather than the specific protection of 

shareholders of a bank or the parent company of a bank. To the 

extent the following material describes statutory or regulatory 
provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 
particular statute or regulation.  
RegulatorsThe Bancorp and/or its banking subsidiary are subject to 

regulation and supervision primarily by the FRB, the Consumer 

Financial Protection Bureau (the ﬁCFPBﬂ) and the Ohio Division 

of Financial Institutions (the ﬁDivisionﬂ) and additionally by 

certain other functional regulators and self-regulatory 

organizations.   The Bancorp is also subject to regulation by the 

SEC by virtue of its status as a public company and due to the 

nature of some of its businesses.  The Bancorp™s banking 

subsidiary is subject to regulation by the FDIC, which insures the 

bank™s deposits as permitted by law.   
The federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable 
to banks and to BHCs regulate, among other matters, the scope of 

their business, their activities, their investments, capital and 

liquidity levels, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the 

availability of deposited funds, the amount of loans to individual 

and related borrowers and the nature, amount of and collateral for 

certain loans, and the amount of interest that may be charged on 

loans as applicable. Various federal and state consumer laws and 

regulations also affect the services provided to consumers.  
The Bancorp and/or its subsidiary are required to file various 
reports with, and is subject to examination by regulators, 

including the FRB and the Division. The FRB, Division and the 

CFPB have the authority to issue orders BHCs and/or banks to 

cease and desist from certain banking practices and violations of 

conditions imposed by, or violations of agreements with, the 
FRB, Division and CFPB. Certain of the Bancorp™s and/or its 
banking subsidiary regulators are also empowered to assess civil 

money penalties against companies or individuals in certain 

situations, such as when there is a violation of a law or regulation. 

Applicable state and federal laws also grant certain regulators the 

authority to impose additional requirements and restrictions on 

the activities of the Bancorp and or its banking subsidiary and, in 

some situations, the imposition of such additional requirements 

and restrictions will not be publicly available information.  
Acquisitions 
The BHCA requires the prior approval of the FRB for a BHC to 

acquire substantially all the assets of a bank or to acquire direct or 

indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of the 

voting shares of any bank, BHC or savings association, or to 
increase any such non-majority ownership or control of any bank, 
BHC or savings association, or to merge or consolidate with any 

BHC.  
The BHCA prohibits a BHC from acquiring a direct or 
indirect interest in or control of more than 5% of any class of the 

voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a BHC and from 

engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of 

banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to 

its banking subsidiaries, except that it may engage in and may 
own shares of companies engaged in certain activities the FRB 
has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or 

controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto. 
Financial Holding Companies  
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (ﬁGLBAﬂ) permits a 

qualifying BHC to become a financial holding company (ﬁFHCﬂ) 

and thereby to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of 

activities than those permitted for a BHC under the BHCA. 

Permitted activities for a FHC include securities underwriting and 

dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking 
and other activities that are declared by the FRB, in cooperation 
with the Treasury Department, to be ﬁfinancial in nature or 

incidental theretoﬂ or are declared by the FRB unilaterally to be 

ﬁcomplementaryﬂ to financial activities. In addition, a FHC is 

allowed to conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire 

permissible non-bank financial companies with after-the-fact 

notice to the FRB. A BHC may elect to become a FHC if each of 

its banking subsidiaries is well capitalized, is well managed and 

has at least a ﬁSatisfactoryﬂ rating under the Community 

Reinvestment Act (ﬁCRAﬂ). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 

and Consumer Protection Act (the ﬁDFAﬂ) also extended the well 

capitalized and well managed requirement to the BHC. In 2000, 

the Bancorp elected and qualified for FHC status under the 

GLBA. To maintain FHC status, a holding company must 
continue to meet certain requirements. The failure to meet such 
requirements could result in material restrictions on the activities 

of the FHC and may also adversely affect the FHC™s ability to 

enter into certain transactions or obtain necessary approvals in 

connection therewith, as well as loss of FHC status. If restrictions 

are imposed on the activities of an FHC, such information may 

not necessarily be available to the public.  
Dividends 
The Bancorp depends in part upon dividends received from its 

direct and indirect subsidiaries, including its indirect banking 

subsidiary, to fund its activities, including the payment of 

dividends. The Bancorp and its banking subsidiary are subject to 

various federal and state restrictions on their ability to pay 

dividends. The FRB has authority to prohibit BHCs from paying 
dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound 
practice. The FRB has indicated generally that it may be an 

unsafe or unsound practice for BHCs to pay dividends unless a 

BHC™s  net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the 

expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the 

organization™s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial 

condition. The ability to pay dividends may be further limited by 

provisions of the DFA and implanting regulations (see 

ﬁRegulatory Reformﬂ).   
Source of Strength 
Under long-standing FRB policy and now as codified in the DFA, 

a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial 

strength to each of its banking subsidiaries and to commit 

resources to their support.  This support may be required at times 
when the BHC may not have the resources to provide it.   
FDIC Assessments  
As contemplated by the DFA the FDIC has revised the 

framework by which insured depository institutions with more 

than $10 billion in assets (ﬁlarge IDIsﬂ) are assessed for purposes 

of payments to the Deposit Insurance Fund (the ﬁDIFﬂ). The final 

rule implementing revisions to the assessment system took effect 

for the quarter beginning April 1, 2011.  
` 174  Fifth Third Bancorp 
Prior to the passage of the DFA, a large IDI™s DIF premiums 
principally were based on the size of an IDI™s domestic deposit 

base. The DFA changed the assessment base from a large IDI™s 

domestic deposit base to its total assets less tangible equity. In 

addition to potentially greatly increasing the size of a large IDI™s 

assessment base, the expansion of the assessment base affords the 

FDIC much greater flexibility to vary its assessment system based 
upon the different asset classes that large IDIs normally hold on 
their balance sheets.  
To implement this provision, the FDIC created an 
assessment scheme vastly different from the deposit-based 

system. Under the new system, large IDIs are assessed under a 

complex ﬁscorecardﬂ methodology that seeks to capture both the 

probability that an individual large IDI will fail and the 

magnitude of the impact on the DIF if such a failure occurs.  
Transactions with Affiliates 
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, restrict 

transactions between a bank and its affiliates (as defined in 

Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act), including a 

parent BHC. The Bancorp™s banking subsidiary is subject to 

certain restrictions, including but not limited to restrictions on 
loans to its affiliates, on investments in the stock or securities 
thereof, on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for 

loans to any borrower, and on the issuance of a guarantee or letter 

of credit on their behalf. Among other things, these restrictions 

limit the amount of such transactions, require collateral in 

prescribed amounts for extensions of credit, prohibit the purchase 

of low quality assets and require that the terms of such 

transactions be substantially equivalent to terms of comparable 

transactions with non-affiliates. Generally, the Bancorp™s banking 

subsidiary is limited in its extension of credit to any affiliate to 

10% of the banking subsidiary™s capital stock and surplus and its 

extension of credit to all affiliates to 20% of the banking 

subsidiary™s capital stock and surplus.  
Community Reinvestment Act
The CRA generally requires insured depository institutions to 
identify the communities they serve and to make loans and 

investments and provide services that meet the credit needs of 

those communities. Furthermore, the CRA requires the FRB to 

evaluate the performance of the Bancorp™s banking subsidiary in 

helping to meet the credit needs of its communities. As a part of 

the CRA program, the banking subsidiary is subject to periodic 

examinations by the FRB, and must maintain comprehensive 

records of their CRA activities for this purpose. During these 

examinations, the FRB rates such institutions™ compliance with 

the CRA as ﬁOutstanding,ﬂ ﬁSatisfactory,ﬂ ﬁNeeds to Improveﬂ or 

ﬁSubstantial Noncompliance.ﬂ Failure of an institution to receive 

at least a ﬁSatisfactoryﬂ rating could inhibit such institution or its 

holding company from undertaking certain activities, including 

engaging in activities permitted as a financial holding company 
under the GLBA and acquiring other financial institutions. The 
FRB must take into account the record of performance of banks in 

meeting the credit needs of the entire community served, 

including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Fifth Third 

Bank received a ﬁSatisfactoryﬂ CRA rating in its most recent 

CRA examination.  
CapitalThe FRB has established capital guidelines for BHCs and FHCs. 

The FRB, the Division and the FDIC have also issued regulations 

establishing capital requirements for banks. Failure to meet 
capital requirements could subject the Bancorp and its banking 
subsidiary to a variety of restrictions and enforcement actions. In 

addition, as discussed previously, the Bancorp and its banking 

subsidiary must remain well capitalized and well managed for the 

Bancorp to retain its status as a FHC. See the ﬁRegulatory 
Reformﬂ section for additional information on capital 
requirements impacting the Bancorp. 
PrivacyThe FRB, FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted 

final guidelines (the ﬁGuidelines) for safeguarding confidential, 

personal customer information. The Guidelines require each 

financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight 

of its Board of Directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to 

create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written 

information security program designed to ensure the security and 

confidentiality of customer information, protect against any 

anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such 

information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of 

such information that could result in substantial harm or 

inconvenience to any customer. The Bancorp has adopted a 

customer information security program that has been approved by 
the Bancorp™s Board of Directors. 
The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement 
policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic 

personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third 

parties. In general, the statute requires explanations to consumers 

on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such 

nonpublic personal information, and, except as otherwise required 

by law, prohibits disclosing such information except as provided 

in the banking subsidiary™s policies and procedures. The 

Bancorp™s banking subsidiary has implemented a privacy policy.  
Anti-Money Laundering 
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing 

Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism 

Act of 2001 (the ﬁPatriot Actﬂ), designed to deny terrorists and 
others the ability to obtain access to the United States financial 
system, has significant implications for depository institutions, 

brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of 

money. The Patriot Act, as implemented by various federal 

regulatory agencies, requires financial institutions, including the 

Bancorp and its subsidiaries, to implement new policies and 

procedures or amend existing policies and procedures with 

respect to, among other matters, anti-money laundering, 

compliance, suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting 

and due diligence on customers. The Patriot Act and its 

underlying regulations also permit information sharing for 

counter-terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement 

agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial 

institutions, subject to certain conditions, and require the FRB 

(and other federal banking agencies) to evaluate the effectiveness 
of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when 
considering applications filed under Section 3 of the BHCA or the 

Bank Merger Act. The Bancorp™s Board has approved policies 

and procedures that are believed to be compliant with the Patriot 

Act.Exempt Brokerage Activities The GLBA amended the federal securities laws to eliminate the 

blanket exceptions that banks traditionally have had from the 

definition of ﬁbrokerﬂ and ﬁdealer.ﬂ The GLBA also required that 

there be certain transactional activities that would not be 
 175  Fifth Third Bancorp 
ﬁbrokerageﬂ activities, which banks could effect without having 
to register as a broker. In September 2007, the FRB and SEC 

approved Regulation R to govern bank securities activities. 

Various exemptions permit banks to conduct activities that would 

otherwise constitute brokerage activities under the securities laws. 

Those exemptions include conducting brokerage activities related 

to trust, fiduciary and similar services, certain services and also 

conducting a de minimis number of riskless principal 

transactions, certain asset-backed transactions and certain 

securities lending transactions. The Bancorp only conducts non-

exempt brokerage activities through its affiliated registered 
broker-dealer.Regulatory Reform 
On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the DFA, 
which is aimed, in part, at accountability and transparency in the 

financial system and includes numerous provisions that apply to 

and/or could impact the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary. The 
DFA implements changes that, among other things, affect the 
oversight and supervision of financial institutions, provide for a 

new resolution procedure for large financial companies, create a 

new agency responsible for implementing and enforcing 

compliance with consumer financial laws, introduce more 

stringent regulatory capital requirements, effect significant 
changes in the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, reform 
the regulation of credit rating agencies, implement changes to 
corporate governance and executive compensation practices, 

incorporate requirements on proprietary trading and investing in 

certain funds by financial institutions (known as the ﬁVolcker 

Ruleﬂ), require registration of advisers to certain private funds, 

and effect significant changes in the securitization market.  Not 

all the rules required or expected to be implemented under the 

DFA  have been proposed or adopted, and certain of the rules that 

have been proposed or adopted under the DFA are subject to 

phase-in or transitional periods. The implication of the DFA for 

the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary continue to depend in 

large part upon the implementation of the legislation by the FRB 

and other agencies. Set forth below is a discussion of some of the 

major sections of the DFA and implementing regulations that 

have or could have a substantial impact on the Bancorp and its 
banking subsidiary. Due to the volume of regulations required by 
the DFA, not all proposed or final regulations that may have an 

impact on the Bancorp or its banking subsidiary are necessarily 

discussed.  
Financial Stability Oversight Council  
The DFA created the Financial Stability Oversight Council 

(ﬁFSOCﬂ), which is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and 

composed of expertise from various financial services regulators. 

The FSOC has responsibility for identifying risks and responding 

to emerging threats to financial stability. On March 15, 2012, the 

Department of Treasury issued an interim final rule to establish 

an assessment schedule for the collection of fees from BHCs and 

foreign banks with at least $50 billion in assets to cover the 

expenses of the Office of Financial Research and FSOC. The fees 
would also cover certain expenses incurred by the FDIC. The 
Bancorp paid approximately $1 million for the assessment 

periods from October 1, 2013 through March 31, 2015.  
On August 16, 2013, the FRB also adopted a final rule to 
implement an assessment provision under the DFA equal to the 

expense and the FRB estimates are necessary or appropriate to 

supervise and regulate BHCs with $50 billion or more in assets. 
The Bancorp paid approximately $3 million for the 2014 annual 
assessment period under the FRB™s rule.  
Executive Compensation 
The DFA provides for a say on pay for shareholders of all public 

companies. Under the DFA, each company must give its 

shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation of its 

executives at least once every three years. The DFA also adds 

disclosure and voting requirements for golden parachute 

compensation that is payable to named executive officers in 

connection with sale transactions. The SEC adopted rules 
finalizing these say on pay provisions in January 2011. 
Pursuant to the DFA, in June 2012, the SEC adopted a final 
rule directing the stock exchanges to prohibit listing classes of 

equity securities if a company™s compensation committee 

members are not independent. The rule also provides that a 

company™s compensation committee may only select a 

compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor after 

taking into consideration factors to be identified by the SEC that 

affect the independence of a compensation consultant, legal 

counsel or other advisor.The SEC is required under the DFA to issue rules obligating 
companies to disclose in proxy materials for annual meetings of 

shareholders information that shows the relationship between 

executive compensation actually paid to their named executive 
officers and their financial performance, taking into account any 
change in the value of the shares of a company™s stock and 

dividends or distributions. The DFA also requires the SEC to 

propose rules requiring companies to disclose the ratio of the 

compensation of its chief executive officer to the median 

compensation of its employees. The SEC proposed rules 

implementing the pay ratio provisions in September 2013. 
The DFA provides that the SEC must issue rules directing 
the stock exchanges to prohibit listing any security of a company 

unless the company develops and implements a policy providing 

for disclosure of the policy of the company on incentive-based 

compensation that is based on financial information required to be 

reported under the securities laws and that, in the event the 

company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to 

the material noncompliance of the company with any financial 
reporting requirement under the securities laws, the company will 
recover from any current or former executive officer of the 

company who received incentive-based compensation during the 

three-year period preceding the date on which the company is 

required to prepare the restatement based on the erroneous data, 

any exceptional compensation above what would have been paid 

under the restatement.  
The DFA requires the SEC to adopt a rule to require that 
each company disclose in the proxy materials for its annual 

meetings whether an employee or board member is permitted to 

purchase financial instruments designed to hedge or offset 

decreases in the market value of equity securities granted as 

compensation or otherwise held by the employee or board 

member.  
Corporate Governance 
The DFA clarifies that the SEC may, but is not required to 
promulgate rules that would require that a company™s proxy 
materials include a nominee for the board of directors submitted 
by a shareholder. Although the SEC promulgated rules to 

accomplish this, these rules were invalidated by a federal appeals 

court decision.  The SEC has said that they will not challenge the 

ruling, but has not ruled out the possibility that new rules could be 

proposed. 
` 176  Fifth Third Bancorp 
The DFA requires stock exchanges to have rules prohibiting 
their members from voting securities that they do not beneficially 

own (unless they have received voting instructions from the 

beneficial owner) with respect to the election of a member of the 

board of directors (other than an uncontested election of directors 

of an investment company registered under the Investment 

Company Act of 1940), executive compensation or any other 
significant matter, as determined by the SEC by rule.  
Credit Ratings  
The DFA includes a number of provisions that are targeted at 

improving the reliability of credit ratings. In August of 2014 the 

SEC adopted new requirements for credit rating agencies to 

enhance governance, protect against conflicts of interest, and 

increase transparency to improve the quality of credit rating 

agency accountability.  
Consumer Issues 
The DFA created a new bureau, the CFPB, which has the 
authority to implement regulations pursuant to numerous 

consumer protection laws and has supervisory authority, 

including the power to conduct examination and take enforcement 

actions, with respect to depository institutions with more than $10 

billion in consolidated assets. The CFPB also has authority, with 

respect to consumer financial services to, among other things, 

restrict unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, enforce laws 
that prohibit discrimination and unfair treatment and to require 
certain consumer disclosures.  
Debit Card Interchange Fees 
The DFA provides for a set of new rules requiring that 

interchange transaction fees for electric debit transactions be 

ﬁreasonableﬂ and proportional to certain costs associated with 

processing the transactions. The FRB was given authority to, 

among other things, establish standards for assessing whether 

interchange fees are reasonable and proportional. In June 2011, 

the FRB issued a final rule establishing certain standards and 

prohibitions pursuant to the DFA, including establishing 

standards for debit card interchange fees and allowing for an 

upward adjustment if the issuer develops and implements policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to prevent fraud.  The 
provisions regarding debit card interchange fees and the fraud 

adjustment became effective October 1, 2011. The rules impose 

requirements on the Bancorp and its banking subsidiary and may 

negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. On July 

31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia 

issued an order granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs in a 

case challenging certain provisions of the FRB™s rule concerning 

electronic debit card transaction fees and network exclusivity 

arrangements (the ﬁCurrent Ruleﬂ) that were adopted to 

implement Section 1075 of the DFA, known as the Durbin 

Amendment. The Court held that, in adopting the Current Rule, 

the FRB violated the Durbin Amendment™s provisions concerning 

which costs are allowed to be taken into account for purposes of 

setting fees that are reasonable and proportional to the costs 
incurred by the issuer and therefore the Current Rule™s maximum 
permissible fees were too high. In addition, the Court held that the 

Current Rule™s network non-exclusivity provisions concerning 

unaffiliated payment networks for debit cards also violated the 

Durbin Amendment. The Court vacated the Current Rule, but 

stayed its ruling to provide the FRB an opportunity to replace the 

invalidated portions. The FRB appealed this decision and on 

March 21, 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 
District Court™s grant of summary judgment and remanded the 
case for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion. The 

merchants have filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the U.S. 

Supreme Court. However, on January 20, 2015, the U.S. Supreme 

Court declined to hear an appeal of the Circuit Court reversal, 

thereby largely upholding the Current Rule and substantially 

reducing uncertainty surrounding debit card interchange fees the 
Bancorp is permitted to charge.  Refer to the Noninterest Income 
subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of 

MD&A for further information regarding the Bancorp™s debit 

card interchange revenue. 
FDIC Matters and Resolution Planning
Title II of the DFA creates an orderly liquidation process that the 
FDIC can employ for failing systemically important financial 

companies. Additionally, the DFA also codifies many of the 

temporary changes that had already been implemented, such as 

permanently increasing the amount of deposit insurance to 

$250,000.In January 2012, the FDIC issued a final rule that requires an 
insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in total 

assets to submit periodic contingency plans to the FDIC for 

resolution in the event of the institution™s failure.  The rule 

became effective in January 2012; however, submission of plans 

are staggered over a period of time.  The Bancorp™s banking 

subsidiary is subject to this rule and submitted its most recent 
resolution plan pursuant to this rule as of December 31, 2014.  
In October 2011, the FRB and FDIC issued a final rule 
implementing the resolution planning requirements of Section 

165(d) of the DFA.  The final rule requires BHCs with assets of 

$50 billion or more and nonbank financial firms designated by 

FSOC for supervision by the FRB to annually submit resolution 

plans to the FDIC and FRB.  Each plan shall describe the 

company™s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy 

during times of financial distress.   Under the final rule, 

companies must submit their initial resolution plans on a 

staggered basis.  The Bancorp submitted its most recent 

resolution plan pursuant to this rule as of December 31, 2014. 
Proprietary Trading and Investing in Certain Funds 
The DFA sets forth new restrictions on banking organizations™ 
ability to engage in proprietary trading and sponsors of or invest 

in private equity and hedge funds (the ﬁVolcker Ruleﬂ). The final 

regulations implementing the Volcker Rule (ﬁFinal Rulesﬂ) were 

adopted on December 10, 2013. The Volcker Rule generally 

prohibits any banking entity from (i) engaging in short-term 

proprietary trading for its own account and (ii) sponsoring or 

acquiring any ownership interest in a private equity or hedge 

fund. The Volcker Rule and Final Rules contain a number of 

exceptions. The Volcker Rule permits transactions in the 

securities of the U.S. government and its agencies, certain 

government-sponsored enterprises and states and their political 

subdivisions, as well as certain investments in small business 

investment companies.  Transactions on behalf of customers and 

in connection with certain underwriting and market making 
activities, as well as risk-mitigating hedging activities and certain 
foreign banking activities are also permitted. The Final Rules 

exclude certain funds from the prohibition on fund ownership and 

sponsorship including wholly-owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, 

and acquisitions vehicles, as well as SEC registered investment 

companies. 
De minimis
 ownership of private equity or hedge 
funds is also permitted under the Final Rules. In addition to the 

general prohibition on sponsorship and investment, the Volcker 
 177  Fifth Third Bancorp 
rule contains additional requirements applicable to any private 
equity or hedge fund that is sponsored by the banking entity or for 

which it serves as investment manager or investment advisor.  

The Bancorp is required under the Final Rules to demonstrate that 

it has a Volcker Rule compliance program. In connection with the 

issuance of the Final Rules, the Federal Reserve extended the 

conformance period generally until July 21, 2015. The Final 

Rules became effective April 2014 and in December 2014, the 

FRB extended the compliance period through July 2016 for 

investments in and relationships with such covered funds that 

were in place prior to December 31, 2013, and  indicated that it 
intends to further extend the compliance period for such 
investments through July 2017.  Further, with respect to covered 

funds that are ﬁilliquid fundsﬂ, the FRB has the authority to grant 
up to five more years for the Bancorp to conform to the final 
Volcker Rule with respect to such illiquid funds.   
Derivatives  
Title VII of the DFA includes measures to broaden the scope of 

derivative instruments subject to regulation by requiring clearing 

and exchange trading of certain derivatives, imposing new capital 

and margin requirements for certain market participants and 

imposing position limits on certain over-the-counter derivatives. 

In 2014, Fifth Third Bank registered as a swap dealer with the 

CFTC and became subject to new substantive requirements, 
including real time trade reporting and robust record keeping 
requirements, business conduct requirements (including daily 

valuations, disclosure of material risks associated with swaps and 

disclosure of material incentives and conflicts of interest), and 

mandatory clearing and exchange trading of all standardized 

swaps designated by the relevant regulatory agencies as required 

to be cleared. As with the Volcker Rule, Fifth Third Bank is 

required to demonstrate that it has a satisfactory compliance 

program to monitor the activities of the swap dealer and comply 

with the applicable regulations. Although the ultimate impact of 

the regulatory changes will depend on the promulgation of all 

final regulations, Fifth Third Bank™s derivatives business will 

likely be further subject to additional substantive requirements 

including margin requirements in excess of current market 

practice and certain capital requirements. These requirements 
may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us 
and may require us to restructure certain businesses and 

negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. 
Interstate Bank Branching 
The DFA includes provisions permitting national and insured 
state banks to engage in 
de novo
 interstate branching if, under the 
laws of the state where the new branch is to be established, a state 

bank chartered in that state would be permitted to establish a 

branch.Systemically Significant Companies and Capital
Title I of the DFA creates a new regulatory regime for large 

BHCs. U.S. BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated 

assets, including Fifth Third, are subject to enhanced prudential 

standards and early remediation requirements under Title I. Title I 

of the DFA establishes a broad framework for identifying, 

applying heightened supervision and regulation to, and (as 

necessary) limiting the size and activities of systemically 
significant financial companies.  
The DFA requires the FRB to impose enhanced capital and 
risk-management standards on these firms and mandates the FRB 

to conduct annual stress tests on all BHCs with $50 billion or 

more in assets to determine whether they have adequate capital 

available to absorb losses in baseline, adverse, or severely adverse 
economic conditions.  In November 2011, the FRB adopted final 
rules requiring BHCs with $50 billion or more in consolidated 

assets to submit capital plans to the FRB on an annual basis.  

Under the final rules, the FRB annually will evaluate an 

institution™s capital adequacy, internal capital adequacy, 

assessment processes and capital distribution plans such as 

dividend payments and stock repurchases. Banks are also required 

to report certain data to the FRB on a quarterly basis to allow the 

FRB to monitor progress against the approved capital plans.   
The CCAR process is intended to help ensure that BHCs 
have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that 
account for each company™s unique risks and that permit 
continued operations during times of economic and financial 

stress. The 2015 CCAR required BHCs with consolidated assets 

of $50 billion or more to submit a capital plan to the FRB by 

January 5, 2015. The mandatory elements of the capital plan are 

an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over a 

nine-quarter planning horizon, a description of all planned capital 

actions over the planning horizon, a discussion of any expected 

changes to the Bancorp™s business plan that are likely to have a 

material impact on its capital adequacy or liquidity, a detailed 

description of the Bancorp™s process for assessing capital 

adequacy and the Bancorp™s capital policy. The stress tests 

require increased involvement by boards of directors in stress 

testing and public disclosure of the results of both the FRB™s 
annual stress tests and a BHC™s annual supervisory stress tests, 
and semi-annual internal stress tests. The Bancorp submitted its 

capital plan, along with all supporting materials, to the FRB on 

January 5, 2015. The FRB will release the results of the 

supervisory stress tests on March 5, 2015 and the related results 

from the 2015 CCAR on March 11, 2015.   
The FRB recently amended its capital planning and stress 
testing rules to, among other things, generally limit a BHC™s 

ability to make quarterly capital distributions Œ that is, dividends 

and share repurchases Œ commencing April 1, 2015 if the amount 

of the bank™s actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of 

instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the 

bank had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it 

received a non-objection from the FRB. For example, if the BHC  

issued a smaller amount of additional common stock than it had 
stated in its capital plan, it would be required to reduce common 
dividends and/or the amount of common stock repurchases so that 

the dollar amount of capital distributions, net of the dollar amount 

of additional common stock issued (ﬁnet distributionsﬂ), is no 

greater than the dollar amount of net distributions relating to its 

common stock included in its capital plan, as measured on an 

aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the nine-quarter 

planning horizon through the end of the then current quarter. 

However, not raising sufficient amounts of common stock as 

planned would not affect distributions related to Additional Tier I 

Capital instruments and/ or Tier II Capital. These limitations also 

contain several important qualifications and exceptions, including 

that scheduled dividend payments on (as opposed to repurchases 

of) a BHC™s Additional Tier I Capital and Tier II Capital 

instruments are not restricted if the BHC fails to issue a sufficient 
amount of such instruments as planned, as well as provisions for 
certainde minimis
 excess distributions.   
In December of 2010 and revised in June of 2011, the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (the ﬁBasel Committeeﬂ) 

issued Basel III, a global regulatory framework, to enhance 

international capital standards. Basel III is designed to materially 

improve the quality of regulatory capital and introduces a new 

minimum common equity requirement. Basel III also raises the 

minimum capital requirements and introduces capital 
` 178  Fifth Third Bancorp 
conservation and countercyclical buffers to induce banking 
organizations to hold capital in excess of regulatory minimums. 

In addition, Basel III establishes an international leverage 

standard for internationally active banks.  
In July of 2013, U.S. banking regulators approved the final 
enhanced regulatory capital rules (ﬁFinal Capital Rulesﬂ), which 

included modifications to the proposed rules. The Final Capital 
Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements 
applicable to BHCs and their depository institution subsidiaries as 

compared to the previous U.S. risk-based capital and leverage 

ratio rules, and thereby implement certain provisions of the DFA.  
The Final Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a 
new capital measure ﬁCommon Equity Tier Iﬂ (ﬁCET1ﬂ), (ii) 

specify that Tier I capital consists of CET1 and ﬁAdditional Tier I 

capitalﬂ instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define 

CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory 

capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other 

components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the 

adjustments as compared to existing regulations. CET1 capital 

consists of common stock instruments that meet the eligibility 

criteria in the final rules, including; common stock and related 

surplus, net of treasury stock and retained earnings, certain 
minority interests and accumulated other comprehensive income 
(ﬁAOCIﬂ), if elected. 
When fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the Final Capital 
Rules require banking organizations to maintain (i) a minimum 

ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 

2.5% ﬁcapital conservation bufferﬂ (which is added to the 4.5% 

CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a 

minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% 

upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier I capital 

to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital 

conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier I capital 

ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a 

minimum Tier I capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), 

(iii) a minimum ratio of total capital (that is, Tier I plus Tier 2 

capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital 
conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio 
as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum 

total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a 

minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier I 

capital to adjusted average consolidated assets. 
Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted 
assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will 

face limitations on the payment of dividends, common stock 

repurchases and discretionary cash payments to executive officers 

based on the amount of the shortfall. 
The Final Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions 
from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the 

requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets 

dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments 

in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to 
the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all 
such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Under 

current capital standards, the effects of AOCI items included in 

capital are excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory 

capital ratios. Under the Final Capital Rules, Bancorp has a one-

time election (the ﬁOpt-out Electionﬂ) to filter certain AOCI 

components, comparable to the treatment under the current 

general risk-based capital rule.The Final Capital Rules were effective for the Bancorp on 
January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain of their 

components and other provisions. Although not currently 
required, Fifth Third Bancorp believes the aforementioned capital 
ratios under the revised Final Capital Rules meet or exceed the 

ratios on a fully phased in basis. Refer to the Non-GAAP section 

of MD&A for an estimate of the Basel III CET1 ratio as of 

December 31, 2014.  
In February 2014, the FRB approved a final rule 
implementing several heightened prudential requirements. 
Beginning in 2015, the rules require BHCs with $10 billion or 
more in consolidated assets to establish risk committees and 

require BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets 

to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management 

standards, including company-run liquidity stress testing and a 

buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs 

for various time horizons, including 30, 60, and 90 days. These 

liquidity-related provisions are designed to be complementary, 

and in addition to the Final LCR Rule applicable to BHCs (as 

discussed below). Rules to implement two other components of 

the DFA™s enhanced prudential standards Œsingle-counterparty 

credit limits and early remediation requirementsŒ are still under 

consideration by the FRB. Fifth Third has conducted a self 

evaluation of all the requirements within the enhanced prudential 

standards, and believe the necessary steps have been taken to 
ensure compliance with all requirements regarding liquidity, risk 
exposures, and early remediation. 
Liquidity Regulation  
Liquidity risk management and supervision have become 

increasingly important since the financial crisis. On September 3, 

2014, the FRB and other banking regulators adopted final rules 

(ﬁFinal LCR Ruleﬂ) implementing a U.S. version of the Basel 

Committee™s Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirement (ﬁLCRﬂ), 

which is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an 

adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets 

(ﬁHQLAﬂ) equal to the entity™s expected net cash outflow for a 

30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash 

outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The rules apply 

in modified form to banking organizations, such as the Bancorp, 
having $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets but less 
than $250 billion. The LCR is the ratio of an institution™s stock of 

HQLA (the numerator) over projected net cash out-flows over the 

30-day horizon (the denominator), in each case, as calculated 

pursuant to the Final LCR Rule. Once fully phased-in, a subject 

institution must maintain an LCR equal to at least 100% in order 

to satisfy this regulatory requirement. Only specific classes of 

assets, including U.S. Treasuries, other U.S. government 

obligations and agency mortgaged-backed securities, qualify 

under the rule as HQLA, with classes of assets deemed relatively 

less liquid and/or subject to greater degree of credit risk subject to 

certain haircuts and caps for purposes of calculating the 

numerator under the Final LCR Rule. The total net cash outflows 

amount is determined under the rule by applying certain 

hypothetical outflow and inflow rates, which reflect certain 
standardized stressed assumptions, against the balances of the 
banking organization™s funding sources, obligations, transactions 

and assets over the 30-day stress period. Inflows that can be 

included to offset outflows are limited to 75% of outflows (which 

effectively means that banking organizations must hold high-

quality liquid assets equal to 25% of outflows even if outflows 

perfectly match inflows over the stress period). The total net cash 

outflow amount for the modified LCR applicable to the Bancorp 

is capped at 70% of the outflow rate that applies to the full LCR.  
The initial compliance date for the modified LCR will be 
January 2016, with the requirement fully phased-in by January 
 179  Fifth Third Bancorp 
2017. The LCR is a minimum requirement, and the FRB can 
impose additional liquidity requirements as a supervisory matter.  

In addition, the Bancorp is also subject to the liquidity-related 

requirements of the enhanced prudential supervision rules 

adopted by the FRB under Section 165 of the DFA, as described 

above. As of December 31, 2014 the Bancorp™s internally 

calculated LCR would have complied with the fully phased in 

LCR requirements which will become effective in 2016 as 

outlined in the final rule.In addition to the LCR, the Basel III framework also 
included a second standard, referred to as the net stable funding 
ratio (ﬁNSFRﬂ), which is designed to promote more medium-and 
long-term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one-

year time horizon.  Although the Basel Committee finalized its 
formulation of the NSFR in 2014, the U.S. banking agencies have 
not yet proposed an NSFR for application to U.S. banking 

organizations or addressed the scope of banking organizations to 

which it will apply.  The Basel Committee™s final NSFR 

document states that the NSFR applies to internationally active 

banks, as did its final LCR document as to that ratio.
